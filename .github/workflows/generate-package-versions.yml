            Update ${{ env.VENV_NAME }} lockfiles and dependency package lockfiles.
            This performs the following updates:
              1) Some ${{ env.VENV_NAME }} lockfiles use ${{ env.VENV_NAME }} `latest`. This will update ${{ env.VENV_NAME }} and dependencies.
              2) Some ${{ env.VENV_NAME }} lockfiles use a pinned (non-latest) version of ${{ env.VENV_NAME }}, but require the `latest` version of another package. This will update all such packages.
