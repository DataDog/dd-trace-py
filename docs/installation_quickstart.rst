Installation + Quickstart
=========================

Before installing be sure to read through the `setup documentation`_ to ensure
your environment is ready to receive traces.


Installation
------------

Install with :code:`pip`::

    pip install ddtrace

We strongly suggest pinning the version of the library you deploy.

Quickstart
----------

Tracing
~~~~~~~

Getting started for tracing is as easy as prefixing your python entry-point
command with ``ddtrace-run``.

For example if you start your application with ``python app.py`` then run::

    ddtrace-run python app.py

For more advanced usage of ``ddtrace-run`` refer to the documentation :ref:`here<ddtracerun>`.


If ``ddtrace-run`` isn't suitable for your application then :ref:`patch_all` can be used::

    import ddtrace

    ddtrace.patch_all()


For information on how to manually create traces refer to the documentation :ref:`here<basic usage>`.

Profiling
~~~~~~~~~

Profiling can also be auto enabled with :ref:`ddtracerun` by providing the
``DD_PROFILING_ENABLED`` environment variable::

    DD_PROFILING_ENABLED=true ddtrace-run python app.py

If ``ddtrace-run`` isn't suitable for your application then
``ddtrace.profiling.auto`` can be used::

    import ddtrace.profiling.auto


Configuration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Almost all configuration of ``ddtrace`` can be done via environment
variable. See the full list in :ref:`Configuration`.

OpenTracing
-----------

``ddtrace`` also provides an OpenTracing API to the Datadog tracer so
that you can use the Datadog tracer in your OpenTracing-compatible
applications.

Installation
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Include OpenTracing with ``ddtrace``::

  $ pip install ddtrace[opentracing]

To include the OpenTracing dependency in your project with ``ddtrace``, ensure
you have the following in ``setup.py``::

    install_requires=[
        "ddtrace[opentracing]",
    ],

Configuration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The OpenTracing convention for initializing a tracer is to define an
initialization method that will configure and instantiate a new tracer and
overwrite the global ``opentracing.tracer`` reference.

Typically this method looks something like::

    from ddtrace.opentracer import Tracer, set_global_tracer

    def init_tracer(service_name):
        """
        Initialize a new Datadog opentracer and set it as the
        global tracer.

        This overwrites the opentracing.tracer reference.
        """
        config = {
          'agent_hostname': 'localhost',
          'agent_port': 8126,
        }
        tracer = Tracer(service_name, config=config)
        set_global_tracer(tracer)
        return tracer

For more advanced usage of OpenTracing in ``ddtrace`` refer to the
documentation :ref:`here<adv_opentracing>`.
