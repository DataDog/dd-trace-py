It appears in his work \\\"Discourse on the Method\\\" (1637).\\n\\nDescartes was attempting to establish a foundation for knowledge that was beyond doubt. He employed a method of systematic doubt, questioning everything he believed to be true, including his own senses and thoughts.\\n\\nHis reasoning was as follows:\\n\\n1. I can doubt everything, including my senses and my body.\\n2. However, the very act of doubting requires me to be thinking.\\n3. If I am thinking, then I must exist. After all, something non-existent can't think.\\n4. Therefore, the one thing I can be certain of is my own existence as a thinking being.\\n\\nIn other words, even if everything else is an illusion or deception, the fact that I am thinking is indisputable proof of my existence. This statement became a foundational element in Descartes' philosophy and a starting point for his further philosophical investigations.\\n\\nIt's important to note that this statement doesn't prove anything else exists besides the thinker. It's just a starting point for Descartes to build up his philosophy and epistemology (theory of knowledge) from a point of certainty.\"}]",
