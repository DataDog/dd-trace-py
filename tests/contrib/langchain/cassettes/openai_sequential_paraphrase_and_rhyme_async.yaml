      myself that there is absolutely nothing in the world, no sky, no earth, no minds,
      no\n            bodies. Does it now follow that I too do not exist? No: if I
      convinced myself of something then I certainly\n            existed. But there
      is a deceiver of supreme power and cunning who is deliberately and constantly
      deceiving\n            me. In that case I too undoubtedly exist, if he is deceiving
      me; and let him deceive me as much as he can,\n            he will never bring
      it about that I am nothing so long as I think that I am something. So after
      considering\n            everything very thoroughly, I must finally conclude
      that this proposition, I am, I exist, is necessarily\n            true whenever
      it is put forward by me or conceived in my mind.\n            \n\n        Paraphrase:
