    body: '{"model": "gpt-3.5-turbo-instruct", "prompt": ["Paraphrase this text:\n\n        \n            I
      have convinced myself that there is absolutely nothing in the world, no sky,
      no earth, no minds, no\n            bodies. Does it now follow that I too do
      not exist? No: if I convinced myself of something then I certainly\n            existed.
      But there is a deceiver of supreme power and cunning who is deliberately and
      constantly deceiving\n            me. In that case I too undoubtedly exist,
      if he is deceiving me; and let him deceive me as much as he can,\n            he
      will never bring it about that I am nothing so long as I think that I am something.
      So after considering\n            everything very thoroughly, I must finally
      conclude that this proposition, I am, I exist, is necessarily\n            true
      whenever it is put forward by me or conceived in my mind.\n            \n\n        Paraphrase:
