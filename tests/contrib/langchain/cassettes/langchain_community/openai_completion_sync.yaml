      is known for his famous statement \\\"Cogito, ergo sum\\\" which is often translated as 
      \\\"I think, therefore I am.\\\" This statement is the foundation of Descartes' philosophy and 
      is found in his work \\\"Meditations on First Philosophy.\\\"\\n\\nDescartes was looking for 
      a solid and absolute foundation for knowledge. He wanted to find something that he could be certain
      of, even if everything else could be doubted. In his search for this foundation,
      he came to the realization that the one thing he could be absolutely certain
      of was his own existence.\\n\\nIn order for Descartes to doubt his own existence,
      he must exist. This is where the phrase \\\"I think, therefore I am\\\" comes
      from. He argued that the very act of thinking and doubting his own existence
      proves that he must exist. Even if he is being deceived by an evil demon or
      if he is in a dream, he must exist in order to have these thoughts.\\n\\nThis
      idea is often referred to as the \\\"cogito\\\" or the \\\"thinking thing\",\n
