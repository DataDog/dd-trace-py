      of something then I certainly existed. But there is a deceiver of supreme power
      and cunning who is deliberately and constantly deceiving me.\nIn that case I
      too undoubtedly exist, if he is deceiving me; and let him deceive me as much
      as he can, he will never bring it about that I am nothing so long as I think
      that I am something. So after considering everything very thoroughly, I must
      finally conclude that this proposition, I am, I exist, is necessarily true whenever
      it is put forward by me or conceived in my mind.\n            \n\n        Paraphrase:
