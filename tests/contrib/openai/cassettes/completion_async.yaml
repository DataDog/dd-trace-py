        I am. That is, I am a thinking thing with a body, and I have a brain that
        divides the world into two classes: the things I perceive and the things that
        are not so perceived. And I must be a thinking thing because I can do things,
        namely, think and act. This is true in virtue of the fact that I am a thing
        that thinks and acts. I am a living thing. I am a human person. I am a thinking,
        feeling, willing, acting being. Therefore, I am a thing that thinks and, therefore,
        a thing that is.\n\nUp to this point, the argument is internal. An infinite
