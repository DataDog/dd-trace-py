# VCR is used to capture and store network requests made to Anthropic.
# This is done to avoid making real calls to the API which could introduce
# flakiness and cost.


# To (re)-generate the cassettes: pass a real Anthropic API key with
# ANTHROPIC_API_KEY, delete the old cassettes and re-run the tests.
# NOTE: be sure to check that the generated cassettes don't contain your
#       API key. Keys should be redacted by the filter_headers option below.
# NOTE: that different cassettes have to be used between sync and async
#       due to this issue: https://github.com/kevin1024/vcrpy/issues/463
#       between cassettes generated for requests and aiohttp.
