"""
Comprehensive tests for import dependency tracking.

These tests ensure that import-time dependencies are correctly tracked across
different scenarios. They serve as regression tests to catch issues if the
import tracking mechanism is refactored in the future.

## Test Coverage

All tests run in BOTH file-level and line-level modes (parametrized):
- 7 test scenarios × 2 modes = 14 test runs total

### What These Tests Verify

1. **Direct imports**: Module A imports Module B → both tracked
2. **Transitive imports**: A→B→C chain → all three tracked  
3. **Imports inside functions**: Lazy imports are tracked correctly
4. **Context isolation**: Import tracking works across multiple test contexts
5. **Internal data structures**: 
   - `_import_names_by_path` is populated correctly
   - `_import_time_name_to_path` maps names to paths
6. **No false positives**: Non-imported modules are not tracked
7. **include_imported flag**: Dependencies only included when requested

### Critical for Future Refactoring

If you refactor the import tracking mechanism, these tests will catch:
- ❌ Missing import dependencies
- ❌ False positive dependencies  
- ❌ Broken transitive dependency resolution
- ❌ Context isolation issues
- ❌ Data structure corruption

### Key Insight for File-Level Mode

File-level coverage achieves import tracking via **bytecode analysis**:
- IMPORT_NAME and IMPORT_FROM opcodes are parsed at instrumentation time
- Import info is reported when PY_START fires (zero runtime cost!)
- This maintains full import dependency tracking without LINE events
