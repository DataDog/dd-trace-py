"""
Test complex nested import scenarios with multiple layers of top-level and dynamic imports.

This test checks if re-instrumentation works correctly when:
- Fixture code has top-level imports
- Fixture code has dynamic (function-level) imports
- Those imported modules themselves have more imports (both top-level and dynamic)
- Multiple contexts execute the same code paths

The fixture modules are in tests/coverage/included_path/:
- nested_fixture.py (main fixture with top-level and dynamic imports)
- layer2_toplevel.py, layer2_dynamic.py (imported by fixture)
- layer3_toplevel.py, layer3_dynamic.py (imported by layer2)
