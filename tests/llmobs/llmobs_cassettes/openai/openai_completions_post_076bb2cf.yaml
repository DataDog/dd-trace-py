        or \\\"I think, therefore I am\\\" is a famous statement by the 17th-century
        philosopher Ren\xE9 Descartes. It is the starting point of his philosophical
        system known as Cartesianism.\\n\\nDescartes believed that in order to find
        absolute certainty, he needed to doubt everything he knew. He questioned the
        existence of external objects, the reliability of his senses, and even whether
        he was dreaming or being deceived by an evil demon.\\n\\nHowever, he realized
        that the very act of doubting and thinking proved his existence. He argued
        that even if he was being deceived, there must be a \\\"deceiver\\\" who is
        deceiving him, and therefore he must exist as a thinking being.\\n\\nIn other
        words, the fact that he was able to doubt and think was enough evidence for
        his existence. He concluded that the one thing he could be sure of was his
        own existence as a thinking being, and this became the foundation of his philosophy.\\n\\nThis
        statement also highlights the importance of the mind or consciousness in defining
        our existence. Descartes believed that our ability to think and reason distinguishes
        us from other creatures and is what ultimately defines our existence. \",\n
