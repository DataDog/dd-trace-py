        or \\\"I think, therefore I am\\\" is a famous statement by the French philosopher
        Ren\xE9 Descartes in his work \\\"Meditations on First Philosophy.\\\" It
        is considered one of the most fundamental and influential ideas in Western
        philosophy.\\n\\nDescartes believed that in order to find certain and indubitable
        knowledge, he needed to doubt everything he had previously believed to be
        true. He even doubted the existence of his own body and the external world.
        However, he realized that he could not doubt the fact that he was doubting,
        which meant that there must be a thinking entity - the self - that was doing
        the doubting.\\n\\nFrom this, Descartes concluded that the only thing he could
        be certain of was his own existence. In other words, the very act of thinking
        and doubting proved that he existed. He wrote, \\\"I am, I exist, is necessarily
        true each time that I pronounce it, or that I mentally conceive it.\\\"\\n\\nTherefore,
        the statement \\\"I think, therefore I am\\\" is Descartes' way of expressing
        his certainty of his own existence as a thinking being. It implies that the
        very act of thinking is evidence of one's own existence. This idea is also
        known as the\",\n      \"index\": 0,\n      \"logprobs\": null,\n      \"finish_reason\":
