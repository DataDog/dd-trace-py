        (I think, therefore I am) is a philosophical statement made by the French
        philosopher Ren\xE9 Descartes. It is a foundational principle in his philosophy,
        which he uses to establish the existence of the self.\\n\\nDescartes begins
        his philosophy by doubting everything that he believes to be true, in order
        to find a solid and indubitable foundation for knowledge. He realizes that
        he could be deceived by his senses or by a powerful, evil demon that manipulates
        his thoughts. However, he also realizes that even if he is being deceived,
        there must be something that is being deceived - a \\\"thinking thing\\\"
        that is having these doubts. This is where the famous phrase \\\"I think,
        therefore I am\\\" comes in.\\n\\nDescartes argues that the very act of doubting,
        questioning, and thinking proves the existence of a thinking entity, or the
        self. This thinking entity, according to Descartes, is the foundation of knowledge
        and the starting point for all other beliefs. He goes on to argue that this
        thinking entity, or the self, is inseparable from his existence and is the
        only thing that he can be certain of.\\n\\nIn summary, Descartes meant that
        the very act of thinking proves the existence\",\n      \"index\": 0,\n      \"logprobs\":
