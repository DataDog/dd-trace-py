      the answer analyze the complexity of each sentence given under ''sentences''
      and break down each sentence into one or more fully understandable statements
      while also ensuring no pronouns are used in each statement. Format the outputs
      in JSON.\n\nThe output should be a well-formatted JSON instance that conforms
      to the JSON schema below.\n\nAs an example, for the schema {\"properties\":
      {\"foo\": {\"title\": \"Foo\", \"description\": \"a list of strings\", \"type\":
      \"array\", \"items\": {\"type\": \"string\"}}}, \"required\": [\"foo\"]}\nthe
      object {\"foo\": [\"bar\", \"baz\"]} is a well-formatted instance of the schema.
      The object {\"properties\": {\"foo\": [\"bar\", \"baz\"]}} is not well-formatted.\n\nHere
      is the output JSON schema:\n```\n{\"type\": \"array\", \"items\": {\"$ref\":
      \"#/definitions/Statements\"}, \"definitions\": {\"Statements\": {\"title\":
      \"Statements\", \"type\": \"object\", \"properties\": {\"sentence_index\": {\"title\":
      \"Sentence Index\", \"description\": \"Index of the sentence from the statement
      list\", \"type\": \"integer\"}, \"simpler_statements\": {\"title\": \"Simpler
      Statements\", \"description\": \"the simpler statements\", \"type\": \"array\",
      \"items\": {\"type\": \"string\"}}}, \"required\": [\"sentence_index\", \"simpler_statements\"]}}}\n```\n\nDo
      not return any preamble or explanations, return only a pure JSON string surrounded
      by triple backticks (```).\n\nExamples:\n\nquestion: \"Who was Albert Einstein
      and what is he best known for?\"\nanswer: \"He was a German-born theoretical
      physicist, widely acknowledged to be one of the greatest and most influential
      physicists of all time. He was best known for developing the theory of relativity,
