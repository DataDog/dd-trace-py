      Albert Einstein?\"\ncontext: \"Albert Einstein (14 March 1879 \u2013 18 April
      1955) was a German-born theoretical physicist, widely held to be one of the
      greatest and most influential scientists of all time. Best known for developing
      the theory of relativity, he also made important contributions to quantum mechanics,
      and was thus a central figure in the revolutionary reshaping of the scientific
      understanding of nature that modern physics accomplished in the first decades
      of the twentieth century. His mass\u2013energy equivalence formula E = mc2,
      which arises from relativity theory, has been called \\\"the world''s most famous
      equation\\\". He received the 1921 Nobel Prize in Physics \\\"for his services
      to theoretical physics, and especially for his discovery of the law of the photoelectric
      effect\\\", a pivotal step in the development of quantum theory. His work is
      also known for its influence on the philosophy of science. In a 1999 poll of
      130 leading physicists worldwide by the British journal Physics World, Einstein
      was ranked the greatest physicist of all time. His intellectual achievements
      and originality have made Einstein synonymous with genius.\"\nanswer: \"Albert
