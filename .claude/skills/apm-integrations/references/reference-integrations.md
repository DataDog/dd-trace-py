# Reference Integrations

Canonical dd-trace-py integrations organized by the 13 integration categories.
**Read the canonical integration for your category before writing code.**

All patch modules live in `ddtrace/contrib/internal/{name}/`.

## By Category

| Category | Canonical | Secondary | Notes |
|----------|-----------|-----------|-------|
| cache | `redis/patch.py` | `pymemcache/patch.py` | Key-value stores, `cache.*` span tags, uses Pin + `context_with_data` via redis_utils |
| cloud-provider | `botocore/patch.py` | `google_genai/patch.py` | AWS services via botocore (Pin + `context_with_data`), GCP via google libs (LLM pattern) |
| database | `psycopg/patch.py` | `mysql/patch.py` | SQL clients, `db.*` span tags, DBM support, uses Pin + dbapi helpers |
| faas | `aws_lambda/patch.py` | `azure_functions/patch.py` | Serverless function wrappers, uses `ddtrace.internal.wrapping` |
| generative-ai | `anthropic/patch.py` | `litellm/patch.py` | LLM/AI integrations; use `llmobs-integrations` for LLMObs lifecycle, extraction, streaming, and tests |
| graphql | `graphql/patch.py` | -- | GraphQL resolvers and operations, shared tracing gate + `tracer.trace` |
| http-client | `httpx/patch.py` | `requests/connection.py` | Outbound HTTP, `http.*` span tags. httpx and requests use `context_with_event` |
| http-server | `flask/patch.py` | `django/patch.py` | Web frameworks, request/response spans, Pin + `context_with_data` |
| logging | `logging/patch.py` | `loguru/patch.py` | Log correlation injection (trace ID, span ID) -- no spans created |
| messaging | `kafka/patch.py` | `kombu/patch.py` | Message brokers, DSM support, Pin + `tracer.trace` |
| object-store | `botocore/patch.py` (S3) | -- | S3 via botocore service-specific handlers |
| orchestration | `celery/patch.py` | -- | Task orchestration, distributed tracing, Pin + `tracer.trace` via signals |
| rpc | `grpc/patch.py` | -- | RPC frameworks, client + server spans, Pin + `tracer.trace` |

## DBAPI Cursor Subclasses

Render queries for DbQueryEvent subscribers with the driver-specific
_render_dbapi_query() hook. Call it only when a subscriber is present. Suppress
ordinary exceptions while rendering and dispatching the event so instrumentation
failures do not interrupt the database call. BlockingException inherits from
BaseException and still stops execution. The rendered value is event data only:
tracing and the driver must continue to receive the original query and parameters.

For psycopg and aiopg composables, call the driver's as_string() with its native
cursor. This includes Literal nodes. Rendering may happen again during execution,
so stateful values inside literals may be adapted twice. For psycopg 3.3 templates,
use its server-query processor for default cursors and sql.as_string() for client
cursors, matching how each cursor sends SQL. Client rendering may also adapt bound
values twice. Django's wrapper cursor exposes the native cursor through its cursor
attribute. Legacy psycopg tracing still renders SQL/Composed resources in
_trace_method(); keep event rendering independent of that APM behavior.

## LLM / Generative AI Detail

This APM reference lists LLM/AI integrations only to help choose comparable
contrib patch modules. For LLMObs-specific architecture, provider extraction,
streaming, and test transport guidance, use the `llmobs-integrations` skill.
