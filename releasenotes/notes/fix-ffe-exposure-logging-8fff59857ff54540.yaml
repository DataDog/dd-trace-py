    openfeature: Fix exposure event deduplication to use (flag_key, subject_id) as cache key
    instead of (flag_key, variant_key, allocation_key). This ensures different users each
    receive their own exposure event while still deduplicating repeated evaluations for the
    same user. Also adds LRU eviction to prevent unbounded memory growth and respects the
    do_log flag from flag metadata.
