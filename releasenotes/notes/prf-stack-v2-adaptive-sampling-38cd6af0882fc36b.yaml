#instructions:
#    The style guide below provides explanations, instructions, and templates to write your own release note.
#    Once finished, all irrelevant sections (including this instruction section) should be removed,
#    and the release note should be committed with the rest of the changes.
#
#    The main goal of a release note is to provide a brief overview of a change and provide actionable steps to the user.
#    The release note should clearly communicate what the change is, why the change was made, and how a user can migrate their code.
#
#    The release note should also clearly distinguish between announcements and user instructions. Use:
#    * Past tense for previous/existing behavior (ex: ``resulted, caused, failed``)
#    * Third person present tense for the change itself (ex: ``adds, fixes, upgrades``)
#    * Active present infinitive for user instructions (ex: ``set, use, add``)
#
#    Release notes should:
#    * Use plain language
#    * Be concise
#    * Include actionable steps with the necessary code changes
#    * Include relevant links (bug issues, upstream issues or release notes, documentation pages)
#    * Use full sentences with sentence-casing and punctuation.
#    * Before using Datadog specific acronyms/terminology, a release note must first introduce them with a definition.
#
#    Release notes should not:
#    * Be vague. Example: ``fixes an issue in tracing``.
#    * Use overly technical language
#    * Use dynamic links (``stable/latest/1.x`` URLs). Instead, use static links (specific version, commit hash) whenever possible so that they don't break in the future.
