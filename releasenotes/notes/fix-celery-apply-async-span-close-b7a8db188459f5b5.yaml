    tracing(celery): Fixes an issue where ``celery.apply`` spans didn't close if the ``after_task_publish`` or ``task_postrun`` signals didn't get sent when using ``apply_async``, which can happen if there is an internal exception during the handling of the task. This update also marks the span as an error if an exception occurs.
