    Fix parsing of the ``DD_TAGS`` environment variable value to include
    support for values with colons (e.g. URLs). Also fixed the parsing of
    invalid tags that begin with a space (e.g. ``DD_TAGS=" key:val"`` will now
    produce a tag with label ``key``, instead of `` key``, and value ``val``).
