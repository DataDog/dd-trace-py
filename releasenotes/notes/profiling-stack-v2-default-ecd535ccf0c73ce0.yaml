    profiling: Stack V2 is enabled by default. It is the new stack sampler
    implementation for CPython 3.8+. It enhances the performance, accuracy,
    and reliability of Python CPU profiling. This feature activates our new
    stack sampling, collection and export system.

    The following are known issues and missing features from Stack V2

  - Services using ``gunicorn`` with Stack V2 results in performance degradation
  - Support for ``gevent`` is lacking
  - Exception sampling is missing

    If you find these as a blocker for enabling Stack V2 for your services, you
    can turn it off via setting ``DD_PROFILING_STACK_V2_ENABLED=0``. If you
    find any other issue, then  please proceed to escalate using appropriate
    support channels or file an issue on the repository.
