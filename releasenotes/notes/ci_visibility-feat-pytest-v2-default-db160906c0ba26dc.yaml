    CI Visibility: Official release of the new version of the pytest plugin, introducing the following features:
      - `Auto Test Retries <https://docs.datadoghq.com/tests/flaky_test_management/auto_test_retries>`_
      - `Early Flake Detection <https://docs.datadoghq.com/tests/flaky_test_management/early_flake_detection>`_
      - Improved coverage collection for `Test Impact Analysis <https://docs.datadoghq.com/tests/test_impact_analysis>`_
        (formerly Intelligent Test Runner), using an internal collection method instead of `coverage.py
        <https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy>`_, with improved dependency discovery.

    **NOTE:** this new version of the plugin introduces breaking changes:
      - ``module``, ``suite``, and ``test`` names are now parsed from the ``item.nodeid`` attribute 
      - test names now include the class for class-based tests
      - Test skipping by Test Impact Analysis (formerly Intelligent Test Runner) is now done at the suite level, instead
        of at the test level

    A beta version of the plugin had been available since v2.18.0, and could be enabled via the
    ``DD_PYTEST_USE_NEW_PLUGIN_BETA`` environment variable. The new version is now the default, and the environment
    variable is not used anymore.
