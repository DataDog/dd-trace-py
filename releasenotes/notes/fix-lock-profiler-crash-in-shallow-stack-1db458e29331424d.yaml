    profiling: Fixed crash in lock profiler when stack traces are too shallow 
    (less than 4 frames). This could occur during interpreter bootstrap, atexit 
    callbacks, or other edge cases. In these rare scenarios, locks may now appear 
    with location "unknown:0" in profiling data instead of causing application crashes.
