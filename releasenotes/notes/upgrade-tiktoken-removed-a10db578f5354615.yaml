    openai: ``tiktoken`` has been removed from ``ddtrace`` as a dependency, and streamed chat/completions will default to having their token counts estimated
     if not explicitly provided in the OpenAI response object. To guarantee accurate streamed token metrics, set ``stream_options={"include_usage": True}`` in the
     OpenAI request.
