    openai: Streamed chat/completions will no longer have token counts computed using the ``tiktoken`` library, and instead
     will default to having their token counts estimated if not explicitly provided in the OpenAI response object.
     To guarantee accurate streamed token metrics, set ``stream_options={"include_usage": True}`` in the OpenAI request.
