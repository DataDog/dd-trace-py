    psycopg: This change resolved an issue where the psycopg traced async connection and dbapi_async objects were not initializing 
    properly due to how the Pin object was accessed. The new psycopg patch now uses a connection factory for the async connection. 
    It takes in the patched psycopg module and uses it to safely get the Pin object.
