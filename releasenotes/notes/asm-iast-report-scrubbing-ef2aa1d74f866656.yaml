    ASM: The vulnerability report now includes a feature to scrub potentially sensitive information. 
    This scrubbing process looks for common patterns, and it can be further expanded using environment 
    variables such as ``DD_IAST_REDACTION_NAME_PATTERN`` and ``DD_IAST_REDACTION_VALUE_PATTERN``. See the `docs <https://ddtrace.readthedocs.io/en/stable/configuration.html#DD_IAST_REDACTION_ENABLED>`_ for more information.
