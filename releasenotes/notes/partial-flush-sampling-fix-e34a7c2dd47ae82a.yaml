    tracing: Fix inconsistent trace sampling during partial flush (traces >300 spans).Now correctly applies sampling rules to the root span instead of a random payload span. 
    Since traces are sampled only once, using the wrong span could bypass sampling rules and cause the agent to apply default rate limits. Fixes regression from v2.8.0.
