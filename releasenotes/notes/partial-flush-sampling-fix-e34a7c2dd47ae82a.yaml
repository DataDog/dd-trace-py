    tracing: Fix inconsistent trace sampling during partial flush (traces >300 spans). Now correctly applies sampling rules to the root span instead of a random payload span. 
    Since traces are sampled only once, using the wrong span could bypass sampling rules and cause the agent to apply default rate limits. Fixes regression introduced in v2.8.0.
