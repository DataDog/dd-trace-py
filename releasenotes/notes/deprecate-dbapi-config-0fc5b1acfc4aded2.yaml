deprecations:
  - |
    Deprecate `ddtrace.config.dbapi2` as default for `TracedCursor` and
    `TracedConnection` as well as `DD_DBAPI2_TRACE_FETCH_METHODS`. Use
    `IntegrationConfig` and `DD_<INTEGRATION>_TRACE_FETCH_METHODS` specific to
    each dbapi-compliant library. For example::

        # Before
        config.dbapi2.trace_fetch_methods = True

        # After
        config.psycopg2.trace_fetch_methods = True
