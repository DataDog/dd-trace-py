    The profiler now updates the trace resource when capturing span information
    with the stack and lock collectors. That means that if the trace resource
    changes after the profiling events are created, the profiler samples will
    also be updated. This avoids having trace resource being empty when
    profiling, e.g., WSGI middleware.
