    Fix for the Remote Configuration Worker creating stuck children under gevent
    when an application uses ``os.fork``. When running Remote Configuration Management
    with gevent, ensure that you set the `DD_GEVENT_PATCH_ALL`` to `true`. Remote Configuration
    Management is enabled by default. If you want to disable it, set the `DD_REMOTE_CONFIGURATION_ENABLED`
    environment variable to `false`.
