  The Datadog APM Python team is happy to announce the release of v2.0.0 of ddtrace.
  This release drops support for Python 2.7, 3.5, and 3.6. This release adds
  support for Python 3.12.


  .. important::

    If you are on version of Python not supported by v2, we will continue to
    maintain the ddtrace v1 with bug fixes.


  .. note::
    Before upgrading to v2.0.0, we recommend users install ``ddtrace~=1.20.0``
    and enable deprecation warnings. All removals to the library interface and
    environment variables in v2 were deprecated in the 1.x release line.


  .. note::
    The changes to environment variables apply only to the configuration of the
    ddtrace library and not the Datadog Agent.


  Upgrading summary

  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


  Functionality changes

  *********************

  The default logging configuration functionality of ddtrace has been changed
  to avoid conflicting with application logging configurations. ``DD_CALL_BASIC_CONFIG``
  has been removed and the ddtrace logger will log to stdout by default, or a log file
  as specified using ``DD_TRACE_LOG_FILE``.


  Setting the environment variable ``DD_TRACE_PROPAGATION_STYLE='b3'`` to enable
  B3 propagation has been removed. Please use
  ``DD_TRACE_PROPAGATION_STYLE='b3multi'`` instead.


  Removed deprecated environment variables

  ****************************************

  These environment variables have been removed. In all cases the same
  functionality is provided by other environment variables and replacements are
  provided as recommended actions for upgrading.

  Removed deprecated library interfaces

  *************************************

  These methods and module attributes have been removed. Where the same
  functionality is provided by a different public method or module attribute, a
  recommended action is provided for upgrading. In a few limited cases, because
  the interface was no longer used or had been moved to the internal interface,
  it was removed and so no action is provided for upgrading.
