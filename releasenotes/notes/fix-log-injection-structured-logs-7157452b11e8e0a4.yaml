    logging: Fix issue when ``dd.*`` properties were not injected onto logging records unless ``DD_LOGS_ENABLED=true`` env var was set (default value is ``structured``).
    This issue causes problems for non-structured loggers which set their own format string instead of having ``ddtrace`` set the logging format string for you.
