    ASM: The new user events policy is preventing users PII to be added by default as span tags. To allow customers using
    the Django auto instrumentation to still have those information, new environment variables have been added.
    In particular DD_DJANGO_INCLUDE_EMAIL (false by default), will tag user events with user email as before.
