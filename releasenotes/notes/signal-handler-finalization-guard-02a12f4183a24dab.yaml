    tracing: Fix potential SIGSEGV when signal handlers are modified during Python interpreter
    shutdown. Signal operations (``signal.signal()``, ``signal.getsignal()``) can crash if
    called after Python's internal signal state has been freed during finalization. The signal
    handling utilities now check ``sys.is_finalizing()`` before attempting signal operations
    and gracefully handle failures. This prevents crashes that could occur when grpc or other
    libraries manipulate signal handlers during shutdown.
