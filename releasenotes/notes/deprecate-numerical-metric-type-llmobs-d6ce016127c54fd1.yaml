    LLM Observability: `numerical` type evaluation metrics is deprecated and will be removed in the next major version of ddtrace.
            All `numerical` type evaluation metrics will be converted and submitted as `score` types.
            As an alternative to `numerical` type evaluation metrics, use the `score` type instead.
