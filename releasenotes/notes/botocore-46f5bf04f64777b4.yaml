    botocore: added `invoke_with_legacy_context` configuration setting, which is disabled by default. This configuration setting is to preserve a legacy behavior in which, when tracing a direct lambda invocation, trace context was propagated by storing it in a `_datadog` object in `context.clientContext.custom`. This must be set to True if you are invoking Lambda functions instrumented with datadog-lambda-python < v41 or datadog-lambda-js < v3.57.0. However, if set to True, invocations to Go or Java Lambda functions may fail.
