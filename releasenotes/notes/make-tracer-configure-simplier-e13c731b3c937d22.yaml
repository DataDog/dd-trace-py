    tracing: Ensures most tracing configurations are only set on application start up. This is done by deprecating the following parameters in ``ddtrace.configure(...)`` function. 
    These parameters will be removed in ``ddtrace>=3.0.0``:
      - hostname
      - port
      - uds_path
      - https
      - sampler
      - priority_sampling
      - settings
      - dogstatsd_url
      - writer
      - partial_flush_enabled
      - partial_flush_min_spans
      - api_version
