    openfeature: This fix resolves an issue where ``DataDogProvider.initialize()`` returned immediately
    without waiting for Remote Configuration data, causing the OpenFeature SDK to emit ``PROVIDER_READY``
    before flag configuration was available. Flag evaluations in this window silently returned default
    values. The provider now blocks in ``initialize()`` until the first configuration arrives or a
    configurable timeout expires (default 30s), matching the behavior of the Java, Go, and Node.js
    providers. The timeout is configurable via the ``DD_EXPERIMENTAL_FLAGGING_PROVIDER_INITIALIZATION_TIMEOUT_MS``
    environment variable or the ``init_timeout`` constructor parameter.
