    kafka: Previously instantiating a subclass of kafka's Producer/Consumer classes would result in attribute errors
    due to patching the Producer/Consumer classes with an ObjectProxy. This fix resolves this issue by making the
    traced classes directly inherit from kafka's base Producer/Consumer classes.
