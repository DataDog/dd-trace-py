    Traces are now collected per tracer instance. Formerly traces were stored
    per execution context so async fragments of a trace would be collected
    independently. Hence trace sampling decisions and applying trace filters
    only applied to the fragments of a trace. Now traces are collected per
    tracer instance and so sampling and trace filters will be provided the
    entire trace.
