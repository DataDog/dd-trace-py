upgrade:
  - |
    Spans are now processed per tracer instance. Formerly spans were stored
    per-Context which could be shared between tracer instances. Note that
    context management is not affected. Tracers will still share active spans.

  - |
    Spans from asynchronous executions (asyncio, gevent, tornado) will now be
    processed and flushed together. Formerly the spans were handled per-task.
