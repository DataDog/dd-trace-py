    Set required header to indicate top level span computation is done in the
    client to the Datadog agent. This fixes an issue where spans were
    erroneously being marked as top level when partial flushing or in certain
    asynchronous applications.

    The impact of this bug is the unintended computation of stats for non-top
    level spans.
