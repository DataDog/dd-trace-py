    django: This introduces the ``DD_DJANGO_TRACING_MINIMAL`` environment variable for performance-sensitive applications.
    When enabled, this disables Django ORM, cache, and template instrumentation while keeping middleware instrumentation enabled.
    This significantly reduces overhead by removing Django-specific spans while preserving visibility into the underlying
    database drivers, cache clients, and other integrations. For example, with this enabled, Django ORM query spans are
    disabled but database driver spans (e.g., psycopg, MySQLdb) will still be created. To enable minimal tracing,
    set ``DD_DJANGO_TRACING_MINIMAL=true``.
