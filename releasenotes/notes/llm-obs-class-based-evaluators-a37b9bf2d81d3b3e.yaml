    LLM Observability: Adds support for class-based evaluators in LLM Observability. Users can now define custom evaluators by subclassing the ``BaseEvaluator`` class, providing more flexibility and structure for implementing evaluation logic. The ``EvaluatorContext`` stores the context of the evaluation, including the dataset record and span information.
