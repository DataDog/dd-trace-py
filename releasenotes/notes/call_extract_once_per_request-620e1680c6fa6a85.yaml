    tracing: This performance fix resolves an issue where Django, Flask, Cherrypy, wsgi, 
    asgi, pyramid, molten, falcon, tornado, aiohttp, bottle, rq, and sanic integrations
    were unnecessarily running code to activate distributed tracing headers multiple times per request.
    This is fixed by only activating distributed tracing headers once per request.
