    tracing: This fix resolves an issue where Django, Flask, Cherrypy, wsgi, 
    asgi, pyramid, molten, falcon, tornado, aiohttp, bottle, rq, and sanic integrations
    were activating distributed tracing headers multiple times on every request. This is 
    fixed by only activating distributed tracing headers once per request.
