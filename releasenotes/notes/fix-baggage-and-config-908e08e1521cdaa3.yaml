    baggage: Fixes a bug where setting ``DD_TRACE_PROPAGATION_HTTP_BAGGAGE_ENABLED`` to ``true`` would not enable baggage propagation.
  - |
    config: Resolves an issue where accessing ``ddtrace.config.<undefined_attribute>`` would create an IntegrationConfig object instead of raising an AttributeError.
