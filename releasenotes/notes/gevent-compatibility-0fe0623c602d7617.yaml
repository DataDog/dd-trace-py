    gevent: This fix resolves incompatibility between `ddtrace-run` and applications that depend on `gevent`, for example `gunicorn` servers. It accomplishes this by
    keeping pre-`gevent.monkey.patch_all()` copies of most modules used by `ddtracepy`. This "module cloning" logic can be controlled by the environment variable
    `DD_UNLOAD_MODULES_FROM_SITECUSTOMIZE`. Valid values for this variable are "yes", "no", and "auto". "yes" tells ddtracepy to run its module cloning logic unconditionally,
    "no" tells it not to run that logic, and "auto" tells it to run module cloning logic *only if* `gevent` monkeypatching is likely to occur in application code.
