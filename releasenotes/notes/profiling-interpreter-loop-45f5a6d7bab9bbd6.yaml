    profiling: This fix resolves an issue where the stack profiler could loop
    infinitely when iterating through Python interpreter states. This could have
    occurred if the interpreter linked list became corrupted or contained a cycle,
    potentially causing the profiler to hang. The fix adds both cycle detection
    and an iteration limit (256 interpreters) to prevent unbounded loops.
