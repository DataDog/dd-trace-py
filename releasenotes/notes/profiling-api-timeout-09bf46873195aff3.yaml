    profiling: ``DD_PROFILING_API_TIMEOUT`` doesn't have any effect, and
    is marked to be removed in upcoming 4.0 release. New environment variable
    ``DD_PROFILING_API_TIMEOUT_MS`` is introduced to configure timeout for
    uploading profiles to the backend. The default value is 10000 ms (10 seconds)
