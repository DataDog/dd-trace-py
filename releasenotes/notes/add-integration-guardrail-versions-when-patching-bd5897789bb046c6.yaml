    Adds a new configuration option `DD_TRACE_SAFE_INSTRUMENTATION_ENABLED` to enable safer patching of integrations.
    When enabled, the tracer will check if the installed version of an integration is compatible with the explicit version range
    specified within the integration's patch module. If an incompatible version is detected, the integration will not be patched 
    and an error message will be logged. Additionally, telemetry describing the integration, whether it was patched, and the
    reason why it was not patched will be sent to help with debugging.

    This feature is disabled by default.

    Also adds explicit integration support ranges for `aiobotocore` (>=1.0.0), `fastapi` (>=0.57.0), and `elasticsearch` (>=1.10).
