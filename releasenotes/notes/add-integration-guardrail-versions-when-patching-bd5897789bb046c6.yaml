    Adds a new configuration option ``DD_TRACE_SAFE_INSTRUMENTATION_ENABLED`` to enable safer patching of integrations.
    
    When enabled, the tracer will check if the installed version of an integration is compatible with the explicit version range
    supported by that integration. If an incompatible version is detected, the integration will not be patched 
    and an error message will be logged.

    This feature is currently disabled by default, but will be enabled by default in a future version.

    Currently the only supported integrations for this feature are: ``aiobotocore`` (>=1.0.0), ``fastapi`` (>=0.57.0), and ``elasticsearch`` (>=1.10).
