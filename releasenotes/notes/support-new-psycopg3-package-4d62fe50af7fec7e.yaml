    psycopg: This release adds support for the new psycopg3 package. This new integration has all the same tracing functionality 
    as the previous psycopg2-binary package, with added support for new methods including async connection and async cursor classes.
    The release also adds support for using Django>=4.2 with psycopg3 integrated tracing.
