    Code Security (IAST): This fix ensures that only the IAST propagation context is cleared instead of all contexts, 
    which could otherwise cause propagation loss in multithreaded applications. Additionally, it improves validations 
    in both the Processor and Vulnerability Reporter, depending on whether IAST is active or not.
