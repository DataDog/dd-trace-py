    data_streams: Add ``kafka_cluster_id`` tag to Kafka offset/backlog tracking for confluent-kafka.
    Previously, cluster ID was only included in DSM checkpoint edge tags (produce/consume) but missing
    from offset commit and produce offset backlogs. This ensures correct attribution of backlog data
    to specific Kafka clusters when multiple clusters share topic names.
