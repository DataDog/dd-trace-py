    Code Security (IAST): Improved compatibility with eval() when used with custom globals and locals. When 
    instrumenting eval(), Python behaves differently depending on whether locals is passed. If both globals and 
    locals are provided, new functions are stored in the locals dictionary. This fix ensures any dynamically 
    defined functions (e.g., via eval(code, globals, locals)) are accessible by copying them from locals to 
    globals when necessary. This resolves issues with third-party libraries (like babel) that rely on this behavior.
