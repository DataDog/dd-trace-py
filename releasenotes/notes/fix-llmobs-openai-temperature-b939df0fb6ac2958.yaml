fixes:
  - |
    LLM Observability: This fix resolves an issue where the OpenAI integration was using the wrong default value of the ``temperature`` parameter 
    to completions and chat completions calls. ``temperature`` is now not set in the metadata if not provided.
  - |
    LLM Observability: This fix removes ``temperature`` and ``max_tokens`` always being set on span metadata from the Anthropic integration. 
    These parameters are now only set in the metadata if provided.
