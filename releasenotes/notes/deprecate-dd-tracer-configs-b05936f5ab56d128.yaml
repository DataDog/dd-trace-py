    This change introduces new config keys for enabling and configuring 
    partial span flushing. 

    This change does not introduce any additional functionality. It only 
    deprecates DD_TRACER... config keys and replaces it an equivalent 
    DD_TRACE... configuration while maintaining backwards compatibility.
upgrade:
  - |
    Replace DD_TRACER_PARTIAL_FLUSH_ENABLED with DD_TRACE_PARTIAL_FLUSH_ENABLED
    Replace DD_TRACER_PARTIAL_FLUSH_MIN_SPANS with DD_TRACE_PARTIAL_FLUSH_MIN_SPANS
deprecations:
  - |
    Adds deprecation warning for the DD_TRACER_PARTIAL_FLUSH_ENABLED and 
    DD_TRACER_PARTIAL_FLUSH_MIN_SPANS configurations. 

    With the release of version 1.0.0 these configuration will no longer be 
    supported and the warnings will be removed.
