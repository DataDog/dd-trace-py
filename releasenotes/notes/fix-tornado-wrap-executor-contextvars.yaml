    tornado: Fixed ``tracer.wrap()`` to correctly measure span durations for Tornado coroutines and
    functions that return Futures, ensuring spans complete only after the asynchronous operation finishes.
    ``tornado.gen.sleep`` is no longer supported for Tornado >=6.1; a warning will be logged if used.
    Users should migrate to ``asyncio.sleep``.
