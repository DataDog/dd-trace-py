    LLM Observability: This fix resolves an issue where duplicate LLM spans were created when using the
    OpenAI agents SDK with the responses API. When both the OpenAI and OpenAI agents SDK integrations
    are active, the OpenAI integration now defers to the agents SDK integration for handling response
    API spans, preventing duplicate spans from being submitted to LLM Observability.
