    wsgi: This change introduces the keyword argument app_is_iterator to the DDWSGIMiddleware constructor.
    It's provided as a workaround for an issue where the Datadog WSGI middleware would fail to handle WSGI
    apps that are not their own iterators. This condition can arise when a Django app attempts to send its
    "request finished" signal, in which case it may cause connection leaks. Standard methods of distinguishing
    an iterable from its iterator, such as checking for the presence of iter and next dunder methods, don't
    work in this case for unknown reasons. Instead of adding brittle special-case detection logic to the
    middleware, this new argument allows users to indicate when this is the case.
