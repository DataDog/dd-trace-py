deprecations:
  - |
    The `ddtrace.utils` folder, and all of its files, has been copied over into
    `ddtrace.internal` in an effort to internalize these modules. All public
    methods contained in these modules have been imported back into their
    filename counterparts in `ddtrace.utils` in order to retain compatibility.
    `ddtrace.utils` will be removed entirely in version 1.0.0.
