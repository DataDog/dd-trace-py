    tracer: This introduces collection of inferred service names.
    The agent version v7.46.0 contains a new field "extra_services" in the remote config client, that allows clients to list any additional services that are used within tracer spans.
    Knowing all service names used by a tracer instance help the UI give better feedback to the user.
