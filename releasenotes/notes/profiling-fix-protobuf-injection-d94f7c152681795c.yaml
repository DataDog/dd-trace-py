    For reporting bug fixes.
    Use past tense for the problem and present tense for the fix and solution in the following format:
    Format: <scope>: This fix resolves an issue where <ABC_bug> caused <XYZ_situation>.
    Profiling: This fix resolves an issue where the profiler was forcing protobuf to load in injected environments,
               causing crashes in configurations which relied on older protobuf versions. The profiler will now detect
               when injection is used and try loading with the native exporter. If that fails, it will self-disable
               rather than loading protobuf.
