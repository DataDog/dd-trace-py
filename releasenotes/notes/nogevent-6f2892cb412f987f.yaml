deprecations:
  - |
    gevent: ``DD_GEVENT_PATCH_ALL`` is deprecated and will be removed in the next major version. Gevent compatibility is now automatic
    and does not require extra configuration when running with ``ddtrace-run``. If not using ``ddtrace-run``, please import ``ddtrace.auto`` before calling ``gevent.monkey.patch_all()``.
fixes:
  - |
    gevent: This fix resolves an incompatibility between ddtrace and gevent that caused threads to hang in certain configurations, for example
    the profiler running in a gunicorn application's gevent worker process.
