features:
  - |
    LLM Observability: Experiments can now be run multiple times by using the optional ``runs`` argument, 
    to assess the true performance of an experiment in the face of the non determinism of LLMs. Use the new ``ExperimentResult`` class' ``runs`` attribute to access the results and summary evaluations by run iteration.
  - |
    LLM Observability: Non-root experiment spans are now tagged with experiment ID, run ID, and run iteration tags.
deprecations:
  - |
    LLM Observability: The ``ExperimentResult`` class' ``rows`` and ``summary_evaluations`` attributes are deprecated and will be removed in the next major release. ``ExperimentResult.rows/summary_evaluations`` attributes will only store the results of the first run iteration for multi-run experiments. Use the ``ExperimentResult.runs`` attribute instead to access experiment results and summary evaluations.
