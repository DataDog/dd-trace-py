    This fix resolves an issue in which traced nested generator functions had their execution order subtly changed
    in a way that affected the stack unwinding sequence during exception handling. The issue was caused
    by the tracer's use of simple iteration via ``for v in g: yield v`` during the wrapping of generator functions
    where full bidrectional communication with the sub-generator via ``yield from g`` was appropriate. See
    PEP380 for an explanation of how these two generator uses differ.
