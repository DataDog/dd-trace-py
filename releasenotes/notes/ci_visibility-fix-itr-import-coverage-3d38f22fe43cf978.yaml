    CI Visibility: This fix resolves an issue where code imported at module level but not executed during a test would
    not be considered by Test Impact Analysis as impacting the test. For example, a test using a constant imported from
    some other module would not count the constant definition among its impacting lines, because the constant definition
    is not executed during the test, but rather when the module was imported. With this change, code executed at import
    time is also included among the impacted lines of a test.
