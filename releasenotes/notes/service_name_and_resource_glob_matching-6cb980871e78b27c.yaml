features:
  - |
    tracing: This introduces Glob matching support for ``service``, ``name``, and ``resource`` passed in with envar ``DD_TRACE_SAMPLE_RULES``.
    Previously, the service, name, and resource were matched using exact string matching.
deprecations:
  - |
    This deprecates the passing in of methods or regex patterns for ``service``, ``name``, and ``resource`` for sampling rules.
    Please use the new Glob matching support instead.
