    ASM: This introduces a new capability to configure the blocking response of ASM. Users can change the default blocking 
    response behavior or create new custom actions.
    Configuration of a custom blocking page or payload can still be provided by using
    `DD_APPSEC_HTTP_BLOCKED_TEMPLATE_JSON` and `DD_APPSEC_HTTP_BLOCKED_TEMPLATE_HTML` to change the static
    files used for the response body.
    The action block, that can be defined in the static rule file or via remote configuration, allows now to create new custom 
    blocking actions with any status code for the response.
