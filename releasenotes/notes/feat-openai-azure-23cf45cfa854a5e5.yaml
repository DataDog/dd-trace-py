features:
  - |
    openai: The OpenAI integration now includes a new ``openai.request.client`` tag with the possible values ``OpenAI/AzureOpenAI`` 
    to help differentiate whether the request was made to Azure OpenAI or OpenAI.
  - |
    LLM Observability: LLM Observability spans generated by the OpenAI integration now have updated span names.
    Span names are now prefixed with the OpenAI client name (example: ``OpenAI/AsyncOpenAI/AzureOpenAI/AsyncAzureOpenAI``) 
    instead of the default ``openai`` prefix to better differentiate between synchronous, asynchronous, Azure, and OpenAI clients.
