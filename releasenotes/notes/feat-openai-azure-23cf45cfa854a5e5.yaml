    openai: The OpenAI integration now includes a new ``openai.request.client`` tag with the possible values ``OpenAI/AzureOpenAI`` 
    to help differentiate whether the request was made to Azure OpenAI or OpenAI.
  - |
    LLM Observability: LLM Observability spans generated by the OpenAI integration now have updated span name and ``model_provider`` values.
    Span names are now prefixed with the OpenAI client name (possible values: ``OpenAI/AzureOpenAI``) 
    instead of the default ``openai`` prefix to better differentiate whether the request was made to Azure OpenAI or OpenAI. 
    The ``model_provider`` field also now corresponds to ``openai`` or ``azure_openai`` based on the OpenAI client.
