#instructions:
#    The style guide below provides explanations, instructions, and templates to write your own release note.
#    Once finished, all irrelevant sections (including this instruction section) should be removed,
#    and the release note should be committed with the rest of the changes.
#
#    The main goal of a release note is to provide a brief overview of a change and provide actionable steps to the user.
#    The release note should clearly communicate what the change is, why the change was made, and how a user can migrate their code.
#
#    The release note should also clearly distinguish between announcements and user instructions. Use:
#    * Past tense for previous/existing behavior (ex: ``resulted, caused, failed``)
#    * Third person present tense for the change itself (ex: ``adds, fixes, upgrades``)
#    * Active present infinitive for user instructions (ex: ``set, use, add``)
#
#    Release notes should:
#    * Use plain language
#    * Be concise
#    * Include actionable steps with the necessary code changes
#    * Include relevant links (bug issues, upstream issues or release notes, documentation pages)
#    * Use full sentences with sentence-casing and punctuation.
#    * Before using Datadog specific acronyms/terminology, a release note must first introduce them with a definition.
#
#    Release notes should not:
#    * Be vague. Example: ``fixes an issue in tracing``.
#    * Use overly technical language
#    * Use dynamic links (``stable/latest/1.x`` URLs). Instead, use static links (specific version, commit hash) whenever possible so that they don't break in the future.
prelude: >
  While ``ddtrace`` aims to support as many versions of a library as possible, this is difficult in practice due to
  the maintenance burden of testing all possible versions of a library. The ``ddtrace`` library's support policy
  moving forward is to have testing support for:
    - The latest major version of a library, which includes testing the oldest and latest minor versions going back 2 years. 
    - The latest minor version for previous major versions going back 2 years.
    - Legacy Python versions will have testing support for the latest version to support that legacy Python version.
  
  .. note:
    While compatibility for older versions has not changed, support for these older versions has ended moving forward 
    and we recommend upgrading to the minimum supported version as indicated on the integration-specific release note below.
