    LLM Observability: This fix addresses an issue where the types accepted for the evaluators argument of LLMObs.experiment was overly constrained due to the use of an invariant type, List. The argument now uses the Sequence type, which is covariant, allowing the user to pass in a list of evaluator functions with narrower return type, for example.
