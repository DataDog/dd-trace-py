    tracing: Resolves an issue where sampling rules with null values for service, resource, or name would not match any spans,
    since these fields are always exported as strings and never null. Now, null and unset fields are treated the same. 
    Ex: `DD_TRACE_SAMPLING_RULES='[{"resource": null, "sample_rate": 1}]'` will be equivalent to `DD_TRACE_SAMPLING_RULES='[{"sample_rate": 1}]'`.
