    ASM: This introduces Exploit Prevention for Application Security Management for 
    LFI (using file opening with standard CPython API) and SSRF (using either standard CPython API urllib or 
    the requests package available on pypi).
    By default, the feature is disabled, but it can be enabled with `DD_APPSEC_RASP_ENABLED=true` in the environment.
