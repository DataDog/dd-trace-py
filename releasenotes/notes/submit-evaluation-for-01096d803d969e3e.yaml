    LLM Observability: This introduces the ability to submit custom evaluations joined to a span by a tag key-value pair using the
                      `LLMObs.submit_evaluation_for()` method. The tag key-value pair is expected to uniquely a span.
                      Example usage: 
                        - Evaluation joined by tag: `LLMObs.submit_evaluation_for(span_with_tag=("message_id", "dummy-message-id"), label="rating", ...)`.
                        - Evaluation joined by trace/span ID: `LLMObs.submit_evaluation_for(span={"trace_id": "...", "span_id": "..."}, label="rating", ...)`.
deprecations:
  - |
    LLM Observability: `LLMObs.submit_evaluation` is deprecated and will be removed in 3.0.0.
                        As an alternative to `LLMObs.submit_evaluation`, you can use `LLMObs.submit_evaluation_for` instead.
                        To migrate, replace `LLMObs.submit_evaluation(span_context={"span_id": ..., "trace_id": ...}, ...)` with:
                          `LLMObs.submit_evaluation_for(span={"span_id": ..., "trace_id": ...}, ...)` if you choose to join by span_id and trace_id
                          or
                          `LLMObs.submit_evaluation_for(span_with_tag=("tag_key", "tag_val"), ...)` if you choose to join by tag.
