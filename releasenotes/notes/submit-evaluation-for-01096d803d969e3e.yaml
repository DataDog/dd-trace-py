    LLM Observability: This introduces the `LLMObs.submit_evaluation_for` method, which provides the ability to join a custom evaluation 
                        to a span using a tag key-value pair on the span. The tag key-value pair is expected to uniquely identify a single span. 
                        Tag-based joining is an alternative to the existing method of joining evaluations to spans using trace and span IDs.
                      Example usage:
                        - Evaluation joined by tag: `LLMObs.submit_evaluation_for(span_with_tag_value={"tag_key": "message_id", "tag_value": "dummy_message_id"}, label="rating", ...)`.
                        - Evaluation joined by trace/span ID: `LLMObs.submit_evaluation_for(span={"trace_id": "...", "span_id": "..."}, label="rating", ...)`.
deprecations:
  - |
    LLM Observability: `LLMObs.submit_evaluation` is deprecated and will be removed in ddtrace 3.0.0.
                        As an alternative to `LLMObs.submit_evaluation`, you can use `LLMObs.submit_evaluation_for` instead.
                        To migrate, replace `LLMObs.submit_evaluation(span_context={"span_id": ..., "trace_id": ...}, ...)` with:
                          `LLMObs.submit_evaluation_for(span={"span_id": ..., "trace_id": ...}, ...)
                        You may also join an evaluation to a span using a tag key-value pair like so:
                          `LLMObs.submit_evaluation_for(span_with_tag_value={"tag_key": ..., "tag_val": ...}, ...)`.
