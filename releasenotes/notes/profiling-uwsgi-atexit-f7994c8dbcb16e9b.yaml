    internal: This fix resolves an issue where ddtrace ignored the uwsgi
    ``--skip-atexit`` flag and registered Python atexit handlers regardless.
    This caused profiler cleanup code to run during process shutdown even when
    ``--skip-atexit`` was set, leading to crashes and hangs in uwsgi workers.
