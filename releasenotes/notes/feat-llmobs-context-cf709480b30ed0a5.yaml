    LLM Observability: Introduces an improved automated context management system for LLM Observability-specific spans.
    Also introduces ``LLMObs.current_span()`` and ``LLMObs.current_trace_context()`` which return the currently active LLM Observability-specific ``Span`` and ``Context`` objects, respectively.
    Also modifies ``LLMObs.export_span()``, ``LLMObs.inject_distributed_headers()``, ``LLMObs.annotate()`` to default to the current active LLM Observability-specific span if ``span`` is not provided.

    LLM Observability: Introduces automated distributed tracing support for LLM Observability traces involving the ``concurrent.futures.thread`` module.
