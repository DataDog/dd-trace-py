upgrade:
  - |
    The profiler ``asyncio_loop_policy`` attribute has been renamed to
    ``asyncio_loop_policy_class`` to accept a user-defined class. This
    guarantees the same asyncio loop policy class can be used process children.

    The profiler now copy all user-provided attributes on fork.
