    Dynamic instrumentation allows instrumenting a running service dynamically
    to extract runtime information that could be useful for, e.g., debugging
    purposes, or to add extra metrics without having to make code changes and
    re-deploy the service. See https://ddtrace.readthedocs.io/en/stable/configuration.html
    for more details.
