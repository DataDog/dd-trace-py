    profiling: implement an experimental stack sampling feature, which can be enabled by setting
    ``DD_PROFILING_STACK_V2_ENABLED=true``. This new sampler should resolve segfault issues on Python
    3.11 and later, while also decreasing the latency contribution of the profiler in many
    situations, and also improving the accuracy of stack-sampling data. This feature is currently
    only available on Linux using CPython 3.8 or greater. Requires
    ``DD_PROFILING_EXPORT_LIBDD_ENABLED=true`` to be set.
