    tracing: Proxy inferred spans now differentiate between API Gateway v1 and v2 apis by emitting the ``aws.httpapi`` span name
    for v2 apis when the API Gateway sets the ``x-dd-proxy`` header to ``aws-httpapi``. Additionally, the tag ``http.route`` and the
    resource name of the span now contains the api resource path instead of the path when propagated with the ``x-dd-proxy-resource-path``
    header.
  - |
    AAP: Proxy inferred spans now contain events when AppSec is enabled so that they are reported on the App and API Protection Endpoint Catalog.
fixes:
  - |
    tracing: Proxy inferred spans used to omit the ``https://`` scheme prefix as part of the `http.url` tag; this caused the entire url to be parsed as the http path.
