    LLM Observability: This fix resolves an issue where ``LLMObs.annotation_context()`` properties (tags, prompt, 
    and name) were not applied to subsequent LLM operations within the same context block. This occurred when 
    multiple sequential operations (such as Langchain batch calls with structured outputs) were performed, 
    causing only the first operation to receive the annotations.
