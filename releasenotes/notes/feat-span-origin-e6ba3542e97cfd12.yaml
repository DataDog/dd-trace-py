    This introduces Code Origin for Span, a new feature that allows collecting
    information about where in the user code entry and exit spans have been
    created. This feature is disabled by default and can be enabled by setting
    the ``DD_CODE_ORIGIN_FOR_SPANS_ENABLED`` environment variable to ``true``.
