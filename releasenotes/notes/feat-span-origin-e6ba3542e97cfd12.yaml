    This introduces Code Origin for Span, a new feature that allows collecting
    information about where entry and exit spans have been created in the
    user code . This feature is disabled by default and can be enabled by setting
    the ``DD_CODE_ORIGIN_FOR_SPANS_ENABLED`` environment variable to ``true``.
