prelude: >
  The Datadog APM Python team is happy to announce the release of v1.0.0 of
  ddtrace. This release introduces a formal :ref:`versioning policy<versioning>`
  that simplifies the public :ref:`interface<versioning_interfaces>` and defines
  a :ref:`release version policy<versioning_release>` for backwards compatible
  and incompatible changes to the public interface.


  The v1.0.0 release is an important milestone for the library as it has grown
  substantially in scope. The first commit to the library was made on June 20,
  2016. Nearly sixty minor releases later, the library now includes over sixty
  integrations for libraries. And the library has expanded from Tracing to support the
  Continuous Profiler and CI Visibility.


  .. important::
    Before upgrading to v1.0.0, we recommend users install
    ``ddtrace>=0.60.0,<1.0.0`` and enable deprecation warnings. All removals to
    the library interface and environment variables were deprecated on 0.x
    branch. Consult :ref:`Upgrade 0.x<upgrade-0.x>` for recommendations
    on migrating from the 0.x release branch.


  .. note::
    The changes to environment variables apply only to the configuration of the
    ddtrace library and not the Datadog Agent.



  Upgrading summary

  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


  Functionality changes

  *********************

  The default logging configuration functionality of ``ddtrace-run`` has
  changed to address conflicts with application logging configuration. See
  :ref:`note on the new default behavior<disable-basic-config-call-by-default>`
  and :ref:`note on deprecation<deprecate-basic-config-call>` for future
  removal.


  Removed legacy environment variables

  ************************************

  These environment variables have been removed. In all cases the same
  functionality is provided by other environment variables and replacements are
  provided as recommended actions for upgrading.

  Removed legacy tracing interfaces

  *********************************

  These methods and module attributes have been removed. Where the same
  functionality is provided by a different public method or module attribute, a
  recommended action is provided for upgrading. In a few limited cases, because
  the interface was no longer used or had been moved to the internal interface,
  it was removed and so no action is provided for upgrading.

  Removed legacy integration tracing

  **********************************

  These tracing functions in integrations were no longer used for automatic
  instrumentation so have been removed. Any manual instrumentation code in an
  application will need to be replaced with :py:meth:`ddtrace.patch_all` or
  :py:meth:`ddtrace.patch` when upgrading.

  Removed deprecated modules

  **************************

  These modules have been removed. Many were moved to the internal interface as
  they were not intended to be used as part of the public interface. In these
  cases, no action is provided for upgrading. In a few cases, other modules are
  provided as alternatives to maintain functionality. See the notes for more
  information.
