    sqlalchemy: sqlalchemy rollbacks could previously cause intermittent deadlocks in some cases.
    To fix this ``DD_TRACE_SPAN_AGGREGATOR_RLOCK`` was introduced in 1.16.2 with the default as ``False``
    with the intent to change the default to ``True`` after further testing. Now that further testing has
    been completed without issue, we are changing the default to ``True``.
