    CI Visibility: This fix resolves an issue where tests would be incorrectly detected as third-party code if a
    third-party package containing a folder with the same name as the tests folder was installed. For instance, the
    ``sumy`` package installs files under ``tests/*`` in ``site-packages``, and this would cause any modules under
    ``tests.*`` to be considered third-party.
