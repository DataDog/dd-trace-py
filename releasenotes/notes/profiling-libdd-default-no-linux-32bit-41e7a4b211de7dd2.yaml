    profiling: The native profile exporter is now the default profile exporter,
    and the legacy Python exporter is removed. The
    ``DD_PROFILING_EXPORT_LIBDD_ENABLED`` configuration variable is removed.
    As a result of this change, profiling for 32-bit Linux is not supported.
    Please file an issue or open a support ticket if you need profiling for
    32-bit Linux.
