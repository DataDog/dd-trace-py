    profiling: Legacy Python based profile exporter is now removed from the code
    base and is replaced with native profile exporter. Unless you have set both
    ``DD_PROFILING_STACK_V2_ENABLED=0`` and ``DD_PROFILING_EXPORT_LIBDD_ENABLED=0``
    this change should have no impact. Drops profiling support for 32-bit Linux.
    Please file an issue or escalate via support channel if you want profiling
    working for 32-bit Linux.
