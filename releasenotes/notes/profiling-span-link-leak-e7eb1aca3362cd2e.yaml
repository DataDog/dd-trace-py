    profiling: when a Python thread finishes, this change frees memory used for mapping
    its thread id to ``Span``. The mapping is populated and used when
    `DD_PROFILING_ENDPOINT_COLLECTION_ENABLED`` and
    ``DD_PROFILING_STACK_V2_ENABLED`` were set to enable grouping of profiles
    for endpoints.
