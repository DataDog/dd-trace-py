    headers would be already sent.
  - |
    ASM: Solve the content-type not always being correct in blocking responses.
  - |
    ASM: Ensure the blocking responses have the following tags: `http.url`, `http.query_string`,
    `http.useragent`, `http.method`, `http.response.headers.content-type` and 
    `http.response.headers.content-length`.
