    LLM Observability: This fix resolves two issues with annotation contexts:
            - annotations registered via annotation contexts were being applied globally. Annotations are now only
            applied to the current trace context and do not pollute to other threads & processes.
            - annotations from nested annotation contexts were applied in a non-deterministic order. Annotations are
            now applied in the order they were registered.
