    AAP: This introduces the WAF trace tagging feature. This feature enables Datadogâ€™s security research team to efficiently gather API security findings without generating appsec events, which bypass tracer sampling mechanisms. As an example, trace-tagging rules can be used to add attributes to traces with details about the signing algorithm and expiration of a JWT token with the goal of providing authentication-related findings.
