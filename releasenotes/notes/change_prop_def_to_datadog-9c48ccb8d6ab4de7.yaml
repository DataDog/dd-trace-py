    propagation: This fix changes the default propagation style for both injection and extraction
    from ``tracecontext,datadog`` to ``datadog``. With the original default, if another company's software 
    used tracecontext headers and sat in-between two Datadog traced services, it would cause propagation 
    to break for Datadog. Specifically this was seen in serverless with Google Cloud Functions.
    To maintain the original default, users can set ``DD_TRACE_PROPAGATION_STYLE=tracecontext,datadog``.
