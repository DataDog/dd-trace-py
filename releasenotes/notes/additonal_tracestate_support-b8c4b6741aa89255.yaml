    propagation: When the tracer is configured to extract and inject ``tracecontext``, 
    the tracer will propagate the tracestate values from other vendors so 
    long as the traceparent trace-id matches the first found trace context,
    regardless of propagator configuration order. To disable this behavior
    ``DD_TRACE_PROPAGATION_EXTRACT_FIRST=true`` can be set.
