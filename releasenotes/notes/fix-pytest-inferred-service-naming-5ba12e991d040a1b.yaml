    ci_visibility: Updates the inferred base service name algorithm to ensure that arguments following ``--ddtrace`` are no 
    longer skipped when executing tests with pytest. Previously, the algorithm misinterpreted these arguments 
    as standard flags, overlooking possible test paths that may contribute to the inferred service name.
