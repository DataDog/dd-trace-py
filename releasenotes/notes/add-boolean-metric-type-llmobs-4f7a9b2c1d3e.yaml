    LLM Observability: Added support to ``submit_evaluation_for()`` for submitting
    boolean metrics in LLMObs evaluation metrics, using ``metric_type="boolean"``.
    This enables tracking binary evaluation results such as toxicity detection and content
    appropriateness in your LLM application workflow.
