    llmobs: Added support for boolean metric type in LLMObs evaluation metrics.
    You can now submit boolean evaluation metrics using ``submit_evaluation()`` and 
    ``submit_evaluation_for()`` methods with ``metric_type="boolean"`` and boolean values.
    This enables tracking binary evaluation results like toxicity detection, content 
    appropriateness, or other yes/no evaluations in your LLM observability workflow.
