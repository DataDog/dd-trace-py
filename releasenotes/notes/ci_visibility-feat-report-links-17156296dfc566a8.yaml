    CI Visibility: This introduces report links to the pytest plugin. At the end of a test session, ddtrace shows links
    to the Datadog Test Optimization pages with the test results for the current commit and for the current CI job
    (provided that the CI environment variables with the current job and pipeline ID are available).
