    profiling: The memory profiler has a guard to avoid re-entering its code if
    there are allocations during sampling. This guard was meant to be
    thread-local, but was not correctly declared as such. This doesn't
    immediately cause problems because the profiler uses try-locks to protect
    access to its data structures, and re-entering the code will fail to acquire
    the locks.  But this bug could be a source of deadlocks or data corruption
    if the code changes substantially in the future. This fix makes the guard
    thread-local as originally intended.
