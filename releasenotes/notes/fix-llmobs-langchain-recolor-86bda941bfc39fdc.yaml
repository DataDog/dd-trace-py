    LLM Observability: Resolves an issue where the langchain integration incorrectly marked openai responses
     as duplicate LLM spans even if there was a downstream LLM span generated by the openai integration.
     Now, all non-proxy langchain LLM/embedding spans representing bedrock, vertexai, openai, and anthropic calls will be marked as workflow.
