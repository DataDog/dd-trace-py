    langchain:  This introduces support for ``langchain==0.1.0``. Note that this does not have tracing support for deprecated
    langchain operations. Please follow the langchain upgrade `guide <https://python.langchain.com/docs/changelog/core>`_ 
    or the langchain integration :ref: `docs<langchain>` to enable full tracing support.
