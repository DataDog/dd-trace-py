    opentelemetry: Enables ddtrace opentelemetry support by default.
    This change will replace the tracer provider set by the opentelemetry-sdk with a custom Datadog TracerProvider. This may be breaking change.
    OpenTelemetry support can be disabled by setting ``DD_TRACE_OTEL_ENABLED=False``.
