    tracing: Updates ``DD_HEADER_TAGS`` and ``DD_TAGS`` to support the following formats:
    ``key1,key2,key3``,  ``key1:val,key2:val,key3:val3``, ``key1:val key2:val key3:val3``, and ``key1 key2 key3``.
    Key value pairs that do not match an expected format will be logged and ignored by the tracer.
