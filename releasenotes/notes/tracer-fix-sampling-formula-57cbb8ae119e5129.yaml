fixes:
  - |
    tracing: fixes an issue where the sampling decision was hardcoded to USER_KEEP when extracting
    sampling priority from HTTP headers, if there was no `x-datadog-sampling-priority` header. The
    sampling decision is now made using the updated sampling formula.
upgrade:
  - |
    tracing: sampling formula updated to have the same as the one in the agent and other tracers.
