    LLM Observability: This fix resolves an issue where using multiple sequential ``annotation_context`` blocks 
    caused annotations to fail after the first operation in subsequent contexts. Previously, the trace context 
    created by the first ``annotation_context`` remained active after exiting, causing the second context to 
    reuse a stale context ID. This resulted in annotations not being applied to spans after the first batch 
    call in the second ``annotation_context`` block.
