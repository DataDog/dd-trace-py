features:
  - |
    tracing: Adds ``tracer.sample`` public method. This should not be called  in most circumstances, 
    but will be useful for advanced users who want to run sampling manually, once lazy sampling is implemented.
deprecations:
  - |
    tracing: deprecates passing a sampler to ``tracer.configure()`` that is not an instance of ``DatadogSampler``.
    The passing of custom sampler instances is largely unusued and will be removed in the next major version update.
