    ASM: New Application Security Events Tracking API, starting with the functions ``track_user_login_success_event`` and
     ``track_user_login_failure_event`` for tracking user logins (it will also internally call ``set_user``) and ``track_custom_event`` for any custom events. 
     You can find these functions in the ``ddtrace.appsec.trace_utils`` module. Calling these functions will create new tags under the ``appsec.events`` 
     namespace (``appsec.events.user.login`` for logins) allowing you to track these events with Datadog. In the future this will 
     be used to provide protection against account takeover attacks (ATO). Public documentation will be online soon.
