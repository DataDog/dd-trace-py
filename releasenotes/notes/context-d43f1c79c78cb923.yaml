prelude: >
    Major breaking changes to context management. See the upgrade section for
    the specifics. Note that only advanced users of the library should be
    affected by the changes.
features:
  - |
    ``tracer.start_span()`` now accepts an ``activate`` argument (default ``False``) to
    allow manual context management.
  - |
    ``tracer.get_call_context()`` has been removed as this functionality no
    longer exists. The replacement API is ``tracer.current_trace_context()``.
upgrade:
  - |
    ``ddtrace.span.Span``
    - ``Span.context`` will now return a ``Context``
  - |
    ``ddtrace.tracer.Tracer``
    - ``tracer.get_call_context()`` will now return ``None`` if there is no active trace.
    - ``tracer.start_span()`` passing a ``span.context`` for ``child_of`` no longer adds
      the ``_parent`` reference to the new span.
  - |
    ``ddtrace.context.Context``
    - No longer maintains the active span state.
    - All methods have been removed.
    - Replace ``context.get_current_span()`` usage with ``tracer.current_span()``.
