    AAP: This fix resolves an issue where the FastAPI body extraction was not functioning correctly in asynchronous contexts for large bodies, leading to missing security events. 
    The timeout for reading request body chunks has been set to 0.1 seconds to ensure timely processing without blocking the event loop.
    This can be configured using the ``DD_FASTAPI_ASYNC_BODY_TIMEOUT_SECONDS`` environment variable.
