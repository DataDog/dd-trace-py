    automatic instrumentation: Introduces generic safeguards for automatic instrumentation ("library injection") in the form of early exit conditions.
    Early exit from instrumentation is triggered if a version of software in the environment is not explicitly supported by ddtrace. The Python runtime
    itself and many Python packages are checked for explicit support on the basis of their version.
