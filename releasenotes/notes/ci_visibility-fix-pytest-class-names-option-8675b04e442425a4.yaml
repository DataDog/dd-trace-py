    CI Visibility: fixes an issue where class-based test methods with the same
    name across classes would be considered duplicates, and cause one (or more)
    tests to be dropped from results, by adding ``--ddtrace-include-class-name``
    as an optional flag (defaulting to false) to prepend the class name to the
    test name.
