    The ``v0.5`` trace API version has been made available and can be selected
    via the newly introduced ``DD_TRACE_API_VERSION`` environment variable by
    setting ``DD_TRACE_API_VERSION="v0.5"``. This newer API version generates
    smaller payloads, thus increasing the trace throughput to the Datadog agent,
    for better performance.
