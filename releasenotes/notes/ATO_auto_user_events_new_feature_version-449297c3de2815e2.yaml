    ASM: The environment variable DD_APPSEC_AUTOMATED_USER_EVENTS_TRACKING is deprecated and will be removed in the next major release.
    Instead of DD_APPSEC_AUTOMATED_USER_EVENTS_TRACKING, you should use DD_APPSEC_AUTO_USER_INSTRUMENTATION_MODE. The "safe" and
    "extended" modes are deprecated and have been replaced by "anonymization" and "identification", respectively.

    ASM: This update introduces new Auto User Events support.

    ASMâ€™s [Account TakeOver (ATO) detection](https://docs.datadoghq.com/security/account_takeover_protection) is now automatically monitoring
    [all compatible user authentication frameworks](https://docs.datadoghq.com/security/application_security/enabling/compatibility/)
    to detect attempted or leaked user credentials during an ATO campaign.

    To do so, the monitoring of the user activity is extended to now collect all forms of user IDs, including non-numerical forms such as
    usernames or emails. This is configurable with 3 different working modes: `identification` to send the user IDs in clear text;
    `anonymization` to send anonymized user IDs; or `disabled` to completely turn off any type of user ID collection (which leads to the
    disablement of the ATO detection).

    The default collection mode being used is `identification` and this is configurable in your remote service configuration settings in the
    [service catalog]( https://app.datadog.com/security/appsec/inventory/services?tab=capabilities) (clicking on a service), or with the
    service environment variable `DD_APPSEC_AUTO_USER_INSTRUMENTATION_MODE`.

    You can read more [here](https://docs.datadoghq.com/security/account_takeover_protection).

    New local configuration environment variables include:
    - `DD_APPSEC_AUTOMATED_USER_EVENTS_TRACKING_ENABLED`: Can be set to "true"/"1" (default if missing) or "false"/"0" (default if
      set to any other value). If set to false, the feature is completely disabled. If enabled, the feature is active.
    - `DD_APPSEC_AUTO_USER_INSTRUMENTATION_MODE`: Can be set to "identification" (default if missing), "anonymization", or
      "disabled" (default if the environment variable is set to any other value). *The values can be modified via remote configuration
      if the feature is active*. If set to "disabled", user events are not collected. Otherwise, user events are collected, using
      either plain text user_id (in identification mode) or hashed user_id (in anonymization mode).

    Additionally, an optional argument for the public API `track_user_login_success_event` and `track_user_login_failure_event`:
    `login_events_mode="auto"`. This allows manual instrumentation to follow remote configuration settings, enabling or disabling
    manual instrumentation with a single remote action on the Datadog UI.

    Also prevents non numerical user ids to be reported by default without user instrumentation in Django.
