    CI Visibility: Official release of the new version of the pytest plugin, with architectural improvements.
    This new version uses an independent span writer for Test Optimization (similar to the ``DD_CIVISIBILITY_USE_BETA_WRITER``
    option), and also contains performance and memory usage improvements.

    A beta version of the plugin had been available since v4.2.0, and could be enabled via the
    ``DD_PYTEST_USE_NEW_PLUGIN`` environment variable. This new version is now the default, and the environment
    variable can be used to revert to the previous plugin if used with false or 0 values.
