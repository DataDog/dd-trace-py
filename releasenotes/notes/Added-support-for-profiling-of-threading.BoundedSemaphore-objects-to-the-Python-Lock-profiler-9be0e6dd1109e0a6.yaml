    profiling: Add support for ``threading.BoundedSemaphore`` locking type profiling in Python. 
    The Lock profiler now detects and marks "internal" Lock objects, i.e. those that are part of implementation of higher-level locking types. One example of such higher-level primitive is ``threading.BoundedSemaphore``, which is implemented with ``threading.Condition``, which itself uses ``threading.Lock`` internally. Marking a locks as internal will prevent it from being logged, which means the sample will only be counted once.
