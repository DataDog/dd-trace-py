    logging: This fixes an issue where a log handler was added to the ddtrace logger
    upon ddtrace import, when not using ddtrace-run. This could lead to duplicate logging 
    if users added additional loggers and did not explicitly modify the ddtrace logger.
    With this fix we will only add the handler if the ddtrace logger is not already 
    configured with one.
