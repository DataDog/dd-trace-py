  - Datadog has added support to automatically create login success or failure events when one of the 
    configured Django authentication backend are used. This will automatically fill the following tags in these cases:

      - `appsec.events.users.login.success.track`
      - `appsec.events.users.login.failure.track`
      - `appsec.events.users.login.failure.usr.exists`
      - `usr.[id|name|email|session_id|role|scope]`

    The behaviour can be configured using the following environment variables:
      - `DD_AUTOMATIC_LOGIN_EVENTS_ENABLED`: to enable or disable.
      - `DD_AUTOMATIC_LOGIN_EVENTS_CUSTOM_USERID_FIELD`: to set user object field to use as `usr.id`. By default it will be `username` for Django (TODO: update once it is defined if we use the DB id)
      - `DD_AUTOMATIC_LOGIN_EVENTS_CUSTOM_[EMAIL|NAME|ROLE|SCOPE]_FIELD` to activate storing these fields and what 
        user object field to use as `usr.id`. Please note that one or more of these fields could be considered private information.
