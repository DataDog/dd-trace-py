    ASM: The list of headers for retrieving the IP when Application Security Management is enabled or the 
      `DD_TRACE_CLIENT_IP_ENABLED` environment variable is set has been updated. "Via" has been 
      removed as it rarely contains IP data and some common vendor headers have been added. You can
      also set the environment variable `DD_TRACE_CLIENT_IP_HEADER` to always retrieve the IP
      from the header specified as the value.
