    ASM: This introduces the support for command injection for Exploit Prevention. With previous support of shell injection with os.system, 
    this provides automatic instrumentation for subprocess module functions and os.spawn* functions, 
    ensuring monitoring and blocking for Exploit Prevention on those endpoints.
