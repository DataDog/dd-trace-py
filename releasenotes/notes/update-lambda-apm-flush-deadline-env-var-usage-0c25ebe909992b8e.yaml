    aws_lambda: Updates how `DD_APM_FLUSH_DEADLINE_MILLISECONDS` is used. Previously, we would set the deadline as the
    environment variable value, if set. Now, when the remaining time in an AWS Lambda invocation is less than `DD_APM_FLUSH_DEADLINE_MILLISECONDS`, the tracer will attempt to submit the current active spans and all finished spans.
    the value in the environment variable is used to subtract from the deadline. The default is still 100ms.
