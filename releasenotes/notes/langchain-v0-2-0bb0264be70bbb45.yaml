    langchain: This fixes an issue of langchain patching errors due to the ``langchain-community`` 
    module becoming an optional dependency in ``langchain>=0.2.0``. The langchain integration now conditionally 
    patches ``langchain-community`` methods if it is available. See the langchain integration :ref: `docs<langchain>` for more details.
