    LLM Observability: Adds built-in evaluators for common evaluation tasks. The following evaluators are now available:

    - ``StringCheckEvaluator``: Performs string comparison operations (equals, not equals, contains, case-insensitive contains).
    - ``RegexMatchEvaluator``: Validates output against regex patterns with search, match, or fullmatch modes.
    - ``LengthEvaluator``: Validates output length constraints by characters, words, or lines.
    - ``JSONEvaluator``: Validates JSON syntax and optionally checks for required keys.
    - ``SemanticSimilarityEvaluator``: Measures semantic similarity between output and expected output using embedding vectors.
