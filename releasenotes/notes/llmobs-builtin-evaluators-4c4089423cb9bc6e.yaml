    LLM Observability: Adds built-in evaluators for common evaluation tasks. The following evaluators are now available:

    - ``StringCheck``: Performs string comparison operations (equals, not equals, contains, case-insensitive contains).
    - ``RegexMatch``: Validates output against regex patterns with search, match, or fullmatch modes.
    - ``LengthValidator``: Validates output length constraints by characters, words, or lines.
    - ``JSONValidator``: Validates JSON syntax and optionally checks for required keys.
    - ``SemanticSimilarity``: Measures semantic similarity between output and expected output using embedding vectors.

    These evaluators can be imported from ``ddtrace.llmobs._evaluators`` and used with the experiments API.
