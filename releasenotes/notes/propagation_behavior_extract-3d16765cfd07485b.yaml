    propagation: Introduces the environment variable ``DD_TRACE_PROPAGATION_BEHAVIOR_EXTRACT`` 
    to control the behavior of the extraction of distributed tracing headers. The values, ``continue`` (default),
    ``ignore``, and ``restart``, are supported. The default value is ``continue`` which has no change from the current behavior of always propagating valid headers.
    ``ignore`` ignores all incoming headers, never propagating the incoming trace information
    and ``restart`` turns the first extracted propagation style into a span link and propagates baggage if extracted.

fixes:
  - |
    propagation: Fixes an issue where the baggage header was not being propagated when the baggage header was the only header extracted.
    With this fix, the baggage header is now propagated when it is the only header extracted.
