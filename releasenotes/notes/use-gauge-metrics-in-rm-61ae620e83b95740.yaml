    runtime_metrics: Introduces support for runtime metrics v2. This feature can be enabled by setting ``DD_TRACE_EXPERIMENTAL_ENABLED=runtime_metrics``.
    The runtime metrics v2 feature allows users to send runtime metrics as Gauge metrics and tags metrics with ``runtime-id`` to provide more context about the runtime environment.
    Note: This feature replaces `runtime.python.` metric prefix with `runtime.python.guage`.
