    profiling: There is currently a known Python 3.11 compatibility issue where the stack collector does not properly 
    access ``PyFrameObject`` member values, as ``PyFrameObject`` is now created and computed lazily in Python 3.11.
    Until this is fixed, we advise against enabling the profiler while using Python 3.11.
