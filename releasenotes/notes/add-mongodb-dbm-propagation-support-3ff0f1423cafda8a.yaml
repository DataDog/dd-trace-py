    Support for Database Monitoring (DBM) propagation in pymongo. Two propagation modes are supported:
    
    - Full mode: Injects both service information and trace context, allowing complete correlation between traces and database monitoring samples.
    - Service mode: Injects only service information, enabling service-level correlation without trace-specific details.
    
    This feature can be controlled using the `DD_DBM_PROPAGATION_MODE` environment variable with values `full`, `service`, or `disabled`.
    
    Example of enabling full or service propagation mode:
    ```
    DD_DBM_PROPAGATION_MODE=full|service
    ```

    Note that this feature requires PyMongo 3.9 or higher.
