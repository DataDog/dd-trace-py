    profiling: Fixes a ``PicklingError`` when using ``multiprocessing.Manager()`` with lock profiling
    enabled on Python 3.14+. Python 3.14 changed the default multiprocessing start method from
    ``fork`` to ``forkserver``, which requires all objects to be pickleable. The lock profiler's
    wrappers now properly support pickle serialization.
