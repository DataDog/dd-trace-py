    tracing: This introduces the keyword parameter "resource" to the SamplingRule constructor, allowing sampling
    rules to be defined based on an exact string match with span resource names. These rules are only evaluated
    at the beginning of a span's lifetime, so changes to Span.resource after span creation are not seen
    by SamplingRules.
