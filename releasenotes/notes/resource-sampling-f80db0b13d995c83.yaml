    tracing: This introduces the keyword parameter ``resource`` to ``SamplingRule.__init__``, allowing sampling
    rules to be defined based on an exact string match with spans' resource names. These rules are only evaluated
    at the beginning of a span's lifetime, so changes to ``Span.resource`` after ``Span.__init__`` are not seen
    by ``SamplingRule``s.
