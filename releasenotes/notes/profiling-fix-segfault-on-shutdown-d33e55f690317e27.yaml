    profiling: Fix race conditions that could cause a segfault during Python interpreter
    shutdown. The native sampling thread and PeriodicThread now properly wait for thread
    completion during shutdown via proper join mechanisms (``pthread_join`` and
    ``std::thread::join``), ensuring threads fully exit before interpreter finalization
    proceeds. This prevents access to freed interpreter structures when threads are
    still unwinding their stacks.
