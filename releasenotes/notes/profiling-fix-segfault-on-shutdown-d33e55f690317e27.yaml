    profiling: Fix a race condition that could cause a segfault during Python interpreter
    shutdown. The native sampling thread now properly waits for completion during profiler
    shutdown via a new join mechanism, and checks ``Py_IsFinalizing()`` to exit early
    when Python is shutting down, preventing access to freed interpreter structures.
