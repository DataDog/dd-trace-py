    opentelemetry: Added support for nested context activation and deactivation using ``attach()`` and ``detach()`` from the OpenTelemetry context API. Deactivating a context properly restores the previous active trace.
    Note: ``detach()`` only supports deactivating the last active trace and baggage. Other signals present in the context will not be restored.
