    ASM: This introduces the "suspicious request blocking" feature for Django and Flask.
issues:
  - |
    ASM: There is a known issue with the flask support for any rule blocking on ``server.request.path_params``.
    The request will be correctly blocked but the client application will be receiving and processing the suspicious request.
    Possible workaround: use ``server.request.uri.raw`` instead, if you want the request to be blocked before entering the flask application.
