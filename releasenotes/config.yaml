# The default is: (?P<pre_release>\.v?\d+(?:[ab]|rc)+\d*)$
# DEV: We have done this to fix how reno collapses pre-releases
#      into the canonical version.
#
#      We have moved the `\.v?\d+` to outside the named "pre_release"
#      matching group because otherwise reno will try to strip
#      ".0rc3" from the release note to match the canonical version
#      when instead it should be "rc3".
