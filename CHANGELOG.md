## 2.21.6


### Bug Fixes

- ASM: Fixed a NotImplementedError that occurred when trying to deepcopy wrapped builtin functions (like <span class="title-ref">open</span>) while ASM or IAST were enabled. The error was caused by the wrapper not implementing the <span class="title-ref">\_\_deepcopy\_\_</span> method.
- LLM Observability: fixes an issue where LLMObs could not be enabled in a forked process when setting `agentless_enabled=True` or `DD_LLMOBS_AGENTLESS_ENABLED=true`.
- profiling: This fix resolves an issue where the Lock profiler would throw an `AttributeError: '_ProfiledThreadingLock' object has no attribute '_self_acquired_at'`.
- pylibmc: fixes an issue where using `Client(server=[url])` would throw the error `__init__() got multiple values for argument 'servers'`

### Other Changes

- library: Ensure that the SSI is not used for uWSGI applications. For enablement instructions, refer to the following our [advanced_usage docs https://ddtrace.readthedocs.io/en/stable/advanced_usage.html#uwsgi]() .

## 3.3.0

### New Features

- Includes <span class="title-ref">dynamodb</span> in the default list of cloud services for payload tagging, i.e. <span class="title-ref">DD_TRACE_CLOUD_PAYLOAD_TAGGING_SERVICES</span> Note that cloud services payload tagging feature is still gated by <span class="title-ref">DD_TRACE_CLOUD_REQUEST_PAYLOAD_TAGGING</span> and <span class="title-ref">DD_TRACE_CLOUD_RESPONSE_PAYLOAD_TAGGING</span>.

- LLM Observability: This introduces tracing for `converse` calls to the Bedrock Converse API. `converse` calls are traced as  
  LLM spans with <span class="title-ref">max_tokens</span>, <span class="title-ref">temperature</span> inference parameters and input/output messages.

- botocore: This introduces capturing prompts, token usage, and inference parameters for `converse` calls to the Bedrock API.

- SCA: This add support for extended heartbeat every 24h with dependencies payload.

- kafka: Adds messaging.destination.name tag to kafka `produce` and `consume` spans.

- LLM Observability: Avoids submitting spans to LLM Observability when a non-default base URL is detected in request for the Anthropic, Bedrock, LangChain, Open AI, and Azure Open AI integrations.

- ASM: This introduces support for automatic instrumentation of session monitoring and blocking for Django.

- ASM: This introduces new metrics span tags to keep track of truncations of WAF payloads.

- runtime_metrics: Adds support for sending runtime metrics as gauge metrics (instead of distributions). To enable this feature set `DD_TRACE_EXPERIMENTAL_FEATURES_ENABLED=DD_RUNTIME_METRICS_ENABLED`.

- runtime_metrics: Adds support for tagging runtime metrics with the current runtime ID. To enable tagging, set `DD_TRACE_EXPERIMENTAL_RUNTIME_ID_ENABLED=True`.
### Bug Fixes

- SCA: This fix resolves an issue where some dependencies where reported with an inaccurate name.
- profiling: This fix resolves an issue where the Lock profiler would throw an `AttributeError: '_ProfiledThreadingLock' object has no attribute '_self_acquired_at'`.

- tags: Updates <span class="title-ref">DD_TAGS</span> parsing to match the Datadog Agent and other SDKs. Key-value pairs can now be separated by both commas and spaces (e.g., <span class="title-ref">DD_TAGS="key1:value1, key2:value2, key3:value3"</span>). This reverts a change introduced in v2.11.0, which only allowed one separator type.

- dynamic sampling: Ensures that dynamic sampling rates are always consistent with the rates received from the agent via remote configuration. Previously, setting a global sample rate and then sampling rules via remote config would result in both configurations being applied. With this fix only the most recent sampling configuration will be applied.

- LLM Observability: This fix resolves an issue where enabling LLM Observability caused all botocore submodules to be patched instead  
  of only `bedrock-runtime`.

- LLM Observability: Resolves issue where Pydantic model objects were encoded as unhelpful default placeholder text.

- LLM Observability: Improves encoding of non-JSON serializable I/O objects by attempting to convert to string before resorting to default placeholder text.

- tracing: Resolves an issue where trace information, such as span links, baggage, and trace-level tags (ex: sampling decision maker), could be lost when a new process was created while a trace was active.

- internal: Fixes an issue where trimming a traceback to attach it to the span could result in the loss of the most recent frames.

- pylibmc: fixes an issue where using `Client(server=[url])` would throw the error `__init__() got multiple values for argument 'servers'`

- tracing: Ensures remote sampling rules no longer overwrite existing samplers, preserving service-based sample rates set by the Agent and ensuring tracer rate limits configured by ddtrace products (e.g., ASM) are always respected.
### Other Changes

- tracing: Ensures a single DatadogSampler is initialized per Tracer instance, improving Tracer object initialization speed by approximately 7% and simplifying sampling logic.
- agent: Migrates agent connection configurations to envier. This provides better documentation and validation for expected types. The following configuration are affected:
  - <span class="title-ref">DD_TRACE_AGENT_URL</span>
  - <span class="title-ref">DD_DOGSTATSD_URL</span>
  - <span class="title-ref">DD_TRACE_AGENT_HOSTNAME</span>
  - <span class="title-ref">DD_AGENT_HOST</span>
  - <span class="title-ref">DD_TRACE_AGENT_PORT</span>
  - <span class="title-ref">DD_DOGSTATSD_PORT</span>
  - <span class="title-ref">DD_AGENT_PORT</span>

  \- <span class="title-ref">DD_TRACE_AGENT_TIMEOUT_SECONDS</span> Of the above impacted configurations, these had a precedence change:
  - <span class="title-ref">DD_TRACE_AGENT_HOSTNAME</span> over <span class="title-ref">DD_AGENT_HOST</span>
  - <span class="title-ref">DD_TRACE_AGENT_PORT</span> over <span class="title-ref">DD_AGENT_PORT</span>
  - <span class="title-ref">DD_DOGSTATSD_HOST</span> over <span class="title-ref">DD_AGENT_HOST</span>
  - <span class="title-ref">DD_DOGSTATSD_PORT</span> over <span class="title-ref">DD_AGENT_PORT</span>

## 2.21.4


### Bug Fixes

  - CI Visibility: This fix resolves an issue where ddtrace's own sys.monitoring coverage tool in Python 3.12+ would block other sys.monitoring tools such as pytest-cov from being used.


---

## 3.2.0

### New Features


  - ASM: This introduces auto instrumentation of signup events for Django.
### Upgrade Notes

  - ASM: To align across products, we're replacing `DD_EXPERIMENTAL_APPSEC_STANDALONE_ENABLED` with `DD_APM_TRACING_ENABLED`. Feature set remains the same.
  - Bumps libdatadog dependency to v16.0.3.

### Bug Fixes

  - celery: When multiple broker URLs are provided as a list, use the first broker URL from a list to avoid parsing errors.
  - CI Visibility: This fix resolves an issue where ddtrace's own sys.monitoring coverage tool in Python 3.12+ would block other sys.monitoring tools such as pytest-cov from being used.
  - tracing: Changes the name of the span event generated by a record\_exception call as it was not following OTEL semantics.
  - Fixes an issue where Profiling native threads would respect the musl libc default stack size, which could cause stack overflows in certain configurations.
  - profiling: The memory profiler has a guard to avoid re-entering its code if there are allocations during sampling. This guard was meant to be thread-local, but was not correctly declared as such. This doesn't immediately cause problems because the profiler uses try-locks to protect access to its data structures, and re-entering the code will fail to acquire the locks. But this bug could be a source of deadlocks or data corruption if the code changes substantially in the future. This fix makes the guard thread-local as originally intended.


---

## 3.1.0

### New Features

- API Gateway: Add preview support to create inferred AWS API Gateway spans when certain AWS Gateway headers are passed into the request. Requires `DD_TRACE_INFERRED_PROXY_SERVICES_ENABLED=true` to enable. For enablement instructions, [contact support.](https://docs.datadoghq.com/help/)

- LLM Observability: Properly labels `Deepseek` for the model provider and span name for LLM Observability spans for calls to Deepseek models using the OpenAI SDK.

- tracing: Introduces a record_exception method that adds an exception to a Span as a span event. Refer to \[Span.record_exception\](<https://ddtrace.readthedocs.io/en/stable/api.html#ddtrace.trace.Span.record_exception>) for more details.

- LLM Observability: Introduces an improved automated context management system for LLM Observability-specific spans. Also modifies `LLMObs.export_span()`, `LLMObs.inject_distributed_headers()`, `LLMObs.annotate()` to default to the current active LLM Observability-specific span if `span` is not provided.

- LLM Observability: Introduces automatic distributed tracing support for LLM Observability traces involving the `concurrent.futures.thread` module.

- Symbol Database is now enabled by default.

- graphql: Add span events on GraphQL error spans, allowing multiple errors to be surfaced on the span.

- graphql: Adds user-provided extensions to graphql error span events through the <span class="title-ref">DD_TRACE_GRAPHQL_ERROR_EXTENSIONS</span> environment variable. This is disabled by default; when set it allows users to capture their extensions.

- LLM Observability: This introduces <span class="title-ref">metadata</span> argument to <span class="title-ref">LLMObs.submit_evaluation_for</span>, which enables users to  
  attach arbitrary structured metadata to custom evaluations.
### Bug Fixes

- tracing: Changes the name of the span event generated by a record_exception call as it was not following OTEL semantics.- internal: Require `bytecode>=0.15.1` for Python 3.12 to avoid [known bug](https://github.com/MatthieuDartiailh/bytecode/issues/130).
- asyncio: Fixes an issue where the name of a coroutine was being overridden by a ddtrace function.
- single-step instrumentation: Removes `boto3` from the minimum versions list to avoid blocking SSI on `boto3` version.
- configurations: This fix resolves an issue where DD_TRACE_CLOUD_PAYLOAD_TAGGING_SERVICES env variable was not parsed correctly
- tracing: Captures the execution of async functions traced via DD_TRACE_METHODS, not just coroutine creation. This change increases span durations, which may affect latency-based metrics.
- ASM: This ensures that no module from ASM are loaded when ASM is disabled or unavailable. SCA: This ensures that no module from IAST are loaded when IAST is disabled or unavailable.
- Resolves ModuleNotFoundError errors raised when a OpenTracing tracer is initialized with a AsyncioScopeManager.
- config: Resolves an issue where accessing `ddtrace.config.<undefined_attribute>` would create an IntegrationConfig object instead of raising an AttributeError.
- botocore: This fix moves bedrock token usage metrics on APM spans from the meta field under `bedrock.usage.{prompt/completion}_tokens` to the metrics field under `bedrock.response.usage.{prompt/completion}_tokens`.
- span: Fix issue where spans weren't being handled correctly and were not being sent when using a custom Exception class that raises an exception in <span class="title-ref">\_\_str\_\_</span>.
- LLM Observability: This fix resolves an issue where the Gemini and Vertex AI integrations were not properly submitting spans for streamed responses in the case that the generator is not fully consumed.
- internal: Fix `ddtrace` internal logger initialization mutating an unlocked shared resource.
- internal: Fix performance overhead of Python distribution parsing for internal telemetry.
- LLM Observability: This fix resolves an issue with correlating traces between APM and LLM Observability where trace IDs were always being converted to hexadecimal values which broke APM links for 64-bit trace IDs.
- profiling: Fixes a crash in memory allocation profiler when tracking a large number of live allocations, caused by unsigned integer wraparound which lead to invalid memory access
- pymongo: Changes the mongodb.query span tag to json so it can be parsed by the agent.
- ASM: This fix resolves an issue where blocking mechanism could partially fail with a 500 error on fastapi with python\>=3.11 with a custom middleware.
- Code Security (IAST): In some applications, unique cookie names are used per request, leading to a high number of unique cookie vulnerabilities. This fix improves detection accuracy by identifying the vulnerability at the <span class="title-ref">set_cookies</span> function and adding more context. **Warning:** This change updates the vulnerability hash, meaning that if it was previously silenced in the web dashboard, it may reappear as a new vulnerability.
- LLM Observability: Fixes non-LLM message inputs and outputs to be rendered as json rather than Python strings.
- profiling: fixes an issue where the profiler unnecessarily outputs log messages when it was unable to record a lock acquire event.
- baggage: Fixed an issue where <span class="title-ref">ot-baggage</span> headers in wsgi apps were not properly recognized due to the <span class="title-ref">http\_</span> header prefix. This ensures consistent baggage propagation in wsgi compatible web frameworks.
- runtime_metrics: Ensures only the global service name is tagged on runtime metrics, instead of every service name found in the process.
- single-step instrumentation: resolves an issue in which incorrect runtime version constraints prevented injection into processes using Python 3.13.1+
- library: Updates the exception raised when `ddtrace.patch(...)` is called with an invalid argument.

## 3.0.0
### **Migration Guide: Upgrading from dd-trace-py v2 to v3**

We are happy to announce the release of v3.0.0 of ddtrace. This release drops support for Python 3.7 and many previously-deprecated parts of the library interface.

The 2.x release line enters Maintenance Mode with the release of 3.0.0, meaning that it will only receive bugfix changes on its last few minor releases, and 2.21 will be the last 2.x minor version. See the [versioning policy](https://docs.datadoghq.com/tracing/trace_collection/compatibility/python/#releases) for support level definitions.

---

#### **Summary of Significant Changes**

* Removed support for Python 3.7 from the library

##### **CI Visibility**

* The new pytest plugin is now the default.  
* Module, suite, and test names are now parsed from `item.nodeid`.  
* Test names now include the class name (`TestClass::test_method`) for class-based tests.  
* Test skipping is now done at the suite level.  
* The `DD_PYTEST_USE_NEW_PLUGIN_BETA` environment variable is no longer used.

##### **LLM Observability**

* Removed support for `DD_LLMOBS_APP_NAME`.  
* The `parameters` argument in `LLMObs.annotate()` has been removed. Use `metadata` instead.  
* Dropped support for OpenAI 0.x and Langchain v0.0.x.

##### **Tracing**

* Removed all deprecated interfaces from integrations.  
* `DD_TRACE_PROPAGATION_STYLE=b3 single header` is no longer supported. Use `b3` instead.  
* Dropped support for multiple Tracer instances. The global tracer instance `ddtrace.tracer` must be used.  
* Removed deprecated parameters from `Tracer.configure(...)`.  
* Dropped support for several deprecated tracing configurations. See “Environment Variables” section below for details.

#### **Recommended Pre-Upgrade Steps**

Before upgrading to v3, check for deprecation warnings in your application using the latest v2 release (**2.21.0**):

##### **Detect Deprecation Warnings in Tests**

Enable warnings as errors in `pytest`:

```
pytest -W "error::ddtrace.DDTraceDeprecationWarning" tests.py
```

##### **Detect Deprecation Warnings in Applications**

Set the following environment variable to raise exceptions for deprecated usage:

```
DD_TRACE_RAISE_DEPRECATIONWARNING=1 ddtrace-run python app.py
```

Alternatively, enable all deprecation warnings:

```
PYTHONWARNINGS=all python app.py
```

##### **Environment Variables**

The following environment variables have been removed or replaced in v3. Use the table below to update your configuration:

| v2 | Removed in v3  | Replaced/Changed in v3 |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **LLM Observability** |  |  |
| `DD_LLMOBS_APP_NAME` |  | Use `DD_LLMOBS_ML_APP` instead |
| `_DD_LLMOBS_EVALUATOR_SAMPLING_RULES` |  | Use `DD_LLMOBS_EVALUATOR_SAMPLING_RULES ` instead |
| `_DD_LLMOBS_EVALUATORS ` |  | Use `DD_LLMOBS_EVALUATORS ` instead |
| **Tracing** |  |  |
| `DD_ANALYTICS_ENABLED` | No replacement, this setting is now a no-op. Datadog Analytics is no longer supported. See the [ingestion controls documentation](https://docs.datadoghq.com/tracing/trace_pipeline/ingestion_mechanisms/?tab=python) for more detail.|  |
| `DD_HTTP_CLIENT_TAG_QUERY_STRING` |  | Use `DD_TRACE_HTTP_CLIENT_TAG_QUERY_STRING`. |
| `DD_TRACE_ANALYTICS_ENABLED` | No replacement, this setting is now a no-op. Datadog Analytics is no longer supported. See the [ingestion controls documentation](https://docs.datadoghq.com/tracing/trace_pipeline/ingestion_mechanisms/?tab=python) for more detail. |  |
| `DD_TRACE_METHODS` (using `[]` notation) |  | Must use `:` notation instead, For example: `mod.submod:method1,method2;mod.submod:Class.method1`. ([docs](https://ddtrace.readthedocs.io/en/stable/configuration.html?highlight=dd_trace_methods#DD_TRACE_METHODS)) |
| `DD_TRACE_PROPAGATION_STYLE=”b3 single header”` |  | Use `DD_TRACE_PROPAGATION_STYLE=b3` for identical behavior |
| `DD_TRACE_SAMPLE_RATE` |  | Use `DD_TRACE_SAMPLING_RULES` ([docs](https://docs.datadoghq.com/tracing/trace_pipeline/ingestion_mechanisms/?tab=python#in-tracing-libraries-user-defined-rules)). |
| `DD_TRACE_SPAN_AGGREGATOR_RLOCK` | No replacement (feature removed). Config variable is now a no-op. |  |
| **CI Visibility** |  |  |
| `DD_PYTEST_USE_NEW_PLUGIN_BETA` | No replacement (new pytest plugin is not in beta anymore). |  |

Use the following patterns to identify the deprecated environment variables in a code base:

```
git grep -P -e "DD_LLMOBS_APP_NAME" \
  -e "_DD_LLMOBS_EVALUATOR_SAMPLING_RULES" \
  -e "_DD_LLMOBS_EVALUATORS" \
  -e "DD_TRACE_PROPAGATION_STYLE=.*b3 single header" \
  -e "DD_TRACE_SAMPLE_RATE" \
  -e "DD_TRACE_API_VERSION=v0.3" \
  -e "DD_ANALYTICS_ENABLED" \
  -e "DD_TRACE_ANALYTICS_ENABLED" \
  -e "DD_HTTP_CLIENT_TAG_QUERY_STRING" \
  -e "DD_TRACE_SPAN_AGGREGATOR_RLOCK" \
  -e "DD_TRACE_METHODS=.*\[\]"
```

Replace deprecated settings with the recommended alternatives where applicable.

**NOTE**: The changes to environment variables apply only to the configuration of the dd-trace-py library and not the Datadog Agent.

##### **Legacy Interfaces**

The following methods and module attributes have been removed or changed. Unless noted, removal means that the functionality pointed to by the removed interface has been disabled.

| v2 | v3 |
| :---- | :---- |
| **Tracing** |  |
| `Tracer.configure( enabled=foo, hostname=foo, port=foo, uds_path=foo, https=foo, sampler=foo, wrap_executor=foo, priority_sampling=foo, settings=foo, dogstatsd_url=foo, writer=foo, partial_flush_enabled=foo, partial_flush_min_spans=foo, api_version=foo )` | `Tracer.configure()` |
| `ddtrace.opentracer.tracer.Tracer()._dd_tracer` | `ddtrace.tracer` |
| `ddtrace.tracer.sampler.rules[].choose_matcher(lambda: True)` | `ddtrace.tracer.sampler.rules[].choose_matcher(“foo”)` Callables and regex patterns are no longer allowed as arguments to `choose_matcher` |
| `Span.sampled` | `Span.context.sampling_priority > 0` |
| **LLM Observability** |  |
| `LLMObs.annotate(parameters=foo)` | `LLMObs.annotate(metadata=foo)` |

##### **Python 3.13 Support**

Much of the library’s functionality has been compatible with Python 3.13 since version 2.20. Some pieces of functionality do not yet work with Python 3.13. Here’s what does not work under Python 3.13 as of dd-trace-py 3.0. 'Not tested' indicates that while the feature may be compatible with Python 3.13, its functionality has not been verified, as it is not included in our automated test coverage.

* `dd-trace-py` doesn’t work on Windows with Python 3.13  
* Appsec Threat Detection is not tested against Django, Flask, or FastAPI with 3.13  
* Automatic Service Naming is not tested with 3.13  
* The following products are not tested with 3.13:  
  * Code Coverage  
  * Appsec IAST  
  * Data Streams Monitoring  
  * CI Visibility  
  * Continuous Profiling  
* The following integrations are not tested with 3.13:  
  * `anthropic`
  * `consul`
  * `freezegun`
  * `gevent`
  * `google_generativeai`
  * `gunicorn`
  * `langchain`  
  * `mysqlclient`

    The integration supports evaluating LLM inferences with the following RAGAS metrics:
    - [Faithfulness](https://docs.ragas.io/en/stable/concepts/metrics/available_metrics/faithfulness/): measures if the LLM response is faithful to the provided context.
    - [Answer Relevancy](https://docs.ragas.io/en/stable/concepts/metrics/available_metrics/answer_relevance/): measures how relevant the LLM response is to the user input.
    - [Context Precision](https://docs.ragas.io/en/stable/concepts/metrics/available_metrics/context_precision/): measures how effectively the context is used in the generated response.

    To learn more, see the [LLM Observability evaluations guide](https://docs.datadoghq.com/llm_observability/submit_evaluations/).


### Upgrade Notes
- CI Visibility

    - `DD_ANALYTICS_ENABLED`, Datadog Analytics is no longer supported.
    - `DD_TRACE_ANALYTICS_ENABLED`, Datadog Analytics is no longer supported.
    - `DD_HTTP_CLIENT_TAG_QUERY_STRING`, `DD_TRACE_HTTP_CLIENT_TAG_QUERY_STRING` should be used instead.
    - `DD_TRACE_SPAN_AGGREGATOR_RLOCK`, disabling the span aggregator rlock is no longer supported.
  - `aws_lambda`: Drops support for `aws_lambda<=6.105.0`.
  - configurations: Drops support for configuring `DD_TRACE_METHODS` with the '[]' notation. Ensure `DD_TRACE_METHODS` use the ':' notation instead".

---

## 2.20.0
### Upgrade Notes
- Tracing
  - Validates Python 3.13 support for the `ddtrace-run` entrypoint.
  - Validates Python 3.13 support for the following integrations:  
    - aiomysql
    - aiopg
    - asyncpg
    - avro
    - botocore
    - confluent-kafka
    - django
    - falcon
    - fastapi
    - grpcio
    - mysqldb
    - protobuf
    - pyodbc
    - sqlalchemy

### Deprecation Notes
- CI Visibility
  - Moves the implementational details of the pytest, pytest_benchmark, pytest_bdd, and unittest integrations from `ddtrace.contrib.<integration>` to `ddtrace.contrib.internal.<integration>`.

- Tracing
  - Deprecates `ddtrace.filters.FilterRequestsOnUrl`. Spans should be filtered/sampled using `DD_TRACE_SAMPLING_RULES` configuration.
  - Deprecates the use of multiple tracer instances in the same process. The global tracer (`ddtrace.tracer`) \`should be used instead.
  - Deprecates support for configuring samplers via a programmatic API. In v3.0.0 samplers will only be configurable via environment variables or remote configuration.
  - Ensures most tracing configurations are only set on application start up. This is done by deprecating the following parameters in `ddtrace.configure(...)` function. These parameters will be removed in `ddtrace>=3.0.0`: - enabled - hostname - port - uds_path - https - sampler - settings - priority_sampling - settings - dogstatsd_url - writer - partial_flush_enabled - partial_flush_min_spans - api_version - compute_stats_enabled - wrap_executor
  - Deprecates `ddtrace.pin` module and moves the `Pin` class to `ddtrace.trace` package. In v3.0.0 the `ddtrace/pin.py` will be removed.
  - Deprecates `ddtrace.filters` module and moves the `TraceFilter` and `FilterRequestsOnUrl` classes to `ddtrace.trace` package. In v3.0.0 the `ddtrace/filters.py` will be removed.
  - Deprecates all attributes in `ddtrace.contrib.trace_utils_async` and `ddtrace.contrib.redis_utils`. Replaces `ddtrace.contrib.trace_utils_async.with_traced_module(...)` with `ddtrace.contrib.trace_utils.with_traced_module_async(...)`. Moves public attributes defined in `ddtrace.contrib.redis_utils.*` to `ddtrace.contrib.trace_utils`.
  - Deprecates the ability to use multiple tracer instances with ddtrace.Pin. In v3.0.0 pin objects will only use the global tracer.
  - Ensures the implementation details of ddtrace integrations are internal to ddtrace library. In `ddtrace>=3.0.0` integrations should only be enabled and configured via `ddtrace.patch(..)`, `import ddtrace.auto` or the `ddtrace-run` command. Unpatching integrations or getting the version of an integration is no longer supported.
  - `rq`: Ensures the implementation details of the rq integration are internal to ddtrace library. In `ddtrace>=3.0.0` this integration should only be enabled and configured via `ddtrace.patch(..)`, `import ddtrace.auto` or the `ddtrace-run` command

### New Features
- ASM
  - Introduces full support for Automated user lifecycle tracking for login events (success and failure)
  - Introduces the support for command injection for Exploit Prevention. With previous support of shell injection with os.system, this provides automatic instrumentation for subprocess module functions and os.spawn\* functions, ensuring monitoring and blocking for Exploit Prevention on those endpoints.

- Code Security
  - Adds support for Header Injection vulnerability sink point.
  - Code Injection vulnerability detection, which will be displayed on your DataDog Vulnerability Explorer dashboard. See the [Application Vulnerability Management](https://docs.datadoghq.com/security/application_security/vulnerability_management/) documentation for more information about this feature.

- LLM Observability
  - `openai`: Introduces automatic extraction of token usage from streamed chat completions. Unless `stream_options: {"include_usage": False}` is explicitly set on your streamed chat completion request, the OpenAI integration will add `stream_options: {"include_usage": True}` to your request and automatically extract the token usage chunk from the streamed response.

- Profiling
  - Stack V2 is enabled by default. It is the new stack sampler implementation for CPython 3.8+. It enhances the performance, accuracy, and reliability of Python CPU profiling. This feature activates our new stack sampling, collection and export system.
  The following are known issues and missing features from Stack V2
    - Services using `gunicorn` with Stack V2 results in performance degradation
    - Support for `gevent` is lacking
  - Exception sampling is missing If you find these as a blocker for enabling Stack V2 for your services, you can turn it off via setting `DD_PROFILING_STACK_V2_ENABLED=0`. If you find any other issue, then please proceed to escalate using appropriate support channels or file an issue on the repository.

- Tracing
  - Introduces the environment variable `DD_TRACE_PROPAGATION_BEHAVIOR_EXTRACT` to control the behavior of the extraction of distributed tracing headers. The values, `continue` (default), `ignore`, and `restart`, are supported. The default value is `continue` which has no change from the current behavior of always propagating valid headers. `ignore` ignores all incoming headers, never propagating the incoming trace information and `restart` turns the first extracted propagation style into a span link and propagates baggage if extracted.


### Bug Fixes

- Code Security
  - Adds more modules to the IAST patching denylist to improve startup time

- Exception Replay
  - Includes missing nonlocal variables in snapshot log messages.

- Lib Injection/SSI
  - Removes python-json-logger from library compatibility check.
  - Fixes incorrect telemetry data payload format.

- LLM Observability
  - Resolves an issue where enabling LLM Observability in agentless mode would result in traces also being sent to the agent proxy endpoint.
  - Resolves an issue where configuring custom trace filters/processors onto the tracer would disable LLM Observability.  
  Note that if LLM Observability is enabled in agentless mode, writing APM traces must be explicitly disabled by setting <span class="title-ref">DD_TRACE_ENABLED=0</span>.
  - `botocore`: Resolves formatting errors in the bedrock integration when parsing request model IDs, which can now accept AWS ARNs.

- Profiling
  - Fixes an issue where the memory allocation profiler can cause a segmentation fault due to data races when accessing its own global data structures from multiple threads.
  - Fixes a bug where profiling mutexes were not cleared on fork in the child process. This could cause deadlocks in certain configurations.
  - Resolves a data race issue accessing lock's acquired time, leading to an `AttributeError`: `_Profiled_ThreadingLock` object has no attribute `self_acquired_at`
  - Resolves an issue where lock release would have been captured with a wrong acquire timestamp
  - Removes a system call from the memory allocation profiler, used to detect forks, which ran on every allocation and resulted in a significant slowdown.

- Tracing
  - Resolves an issue where baggage header extraction was case sensitive and didn't accept the header prepended with HTTP. Now the baggage header will be extracted regardless of casing and the HTTP format.
  - Resolves an issue where the core instrumentation could raise an uncaught exception.
  - Improves error handling for exceptions raised during the startup of ddtrace integrations. This reduces the likelihood of the ddtrace library raising unhandled exceptions.
  - Fixes an issue where the baggage header was not being propagated when the baggage header was the only header extracted. With this fix, the baggage header is now propagated when it is the only header extracted.
  - `asgi`: Resolves an issue parsing response cookies in FastAPI and awsgi
  - `asyncio`: Resolves an issue where asyncio event loops fail to register when `ddtrace-run`/`import ddtrace.auto` is used and gevent is installed.
  - `celery`: Fixes an issue where `celery.apply` spans from Celery prerun got closed too soon leading to span tags being missing.
  - `django`: Fixes issue where django cache is represented as a django service rather than the third party service.


### Other Changes
- Lib Injection/SSI
  - Reduces size of OCI image size to improve k8s lib-injection pull and startup times.

## 2.18.0

### Upgrade Notes
- ASM
  - With this upgrade, you can now control how the stack trace report are cropped when reported for exploit prevention or IAST.  
    - `DD_APPSEC_MAX_STACK_TRACE_DEPTH` allowed to control the maximum stack trace size reported (default 32)
    - `DD_APPSEC_MAX_STACK_TRACE_DEPTH_TOP_PERCENT` allows now to specify how the stack trace is cropped as a percentage.

    For example, a value of 100 will report the top DD_APPSEC_MAX_STACK_TRACE_DEPTH frames from the stack, while a value of 0 will report the bottom DD_APPSEC_MAX_STACK_TRACE_DEPTH frames of the trace. A value of 50 will report half of DD_APPSEC_MAX_STACK_TRACE_DEPTH (rounded down) frames from the top of the stack and the rest from bottom. Default value is 75.

### Bug Fixes
- ASM
  - Ensures that common patches for exploit prevention and sca are only loaded if required, and only loaded once.
  - Resolves an issue where AppSec was using a patched JSON loads, creating telemetry errors.
  - Resolves an issue where some root span where not appropriately tagged for ASM standalone.
  - ASM: Resolves an issue where AppSec was using a patched request and builtins functions, 
    creating telemetry errors.

- CI Visibility
  - Fixes an issue where the CIVisbility service would incorrectly default the tracer env to `None` in EVP proxy mode if `DD_ENV` was not specified but the agent had a default environment set to a value other than `none` (eg: using `DD_APM_ENV` in the agent's environment).
  - Updates the inferred base service name algorithm to ensure that arguments following `--ddtrace` are no longer skipped when executing tests with pytest. Previously, the algorithm misinterpreted these arguments as standard flags, overlooking possible test paths that may contribute to the inferred service name.

- Code Security
  - Patches the module dir function so original pre-patch results are not changed.
  - Resolves a patching issue with `psycopg3`.
  - This fix resolves an issue where the modulo (%) operator would not be replaced correctly for bytes and bytesarray if IAST is enabled.
  - Ensures IAST SSRF vulnerability redacts the url query parameters correctly.
  - Adds `umap`, `numba` and `pynndescent` to the Code Security denylist.

- Crashtracking
  - Resolves issue where the crashtracker receiver may leave a zombie process behind after a crash.

- Lib-Injection
  - Ensures any user defined `sitecustomize.py` are preserved when auto-injecting.
  - Supports Python 2.7+ for injection compatibility check.
  - Resolves an issue where the default versions of `click` and `jinja2` installed on 3.8 were outside of the allowed minimum versions for autoinstrumentation.

- LLM Observability
  - Ensures bedrock spans are finished even when streamed responses are not fully consumed.
  - `langchain`: Resolves a JSON decoding issue resulting from tagging streamed outputs from chains ending with a PydanticOutputParser.
  - Fixes an issue where decorators were not tracing generator functions properly.

- Profiling
  - Updates setup.py to ignore int-ptr conversion warnings for the profiler stack.pyx file. This is important because gcc 14 makes these conversions an error, alpine 3.21.0 ships with gcc 14, and any patch version of a Python alpine image cut after December 5th, 2024, will have this issue.
  - Fixes unbounded memory usage growth caused by keeping arbitrary user-generated strings (e.g. asyncio Task names) in an internal table and never removing them.
  - Fixes an issue where `asyncio` task names are not properly propagated when using stack v2, i.e. when `DD_PROFILING_STACK_V2_ENABLED` is set. Fixes an issue where `asyncio` tasks are not associated with spans when using stack v2, i.e. when `DD_PROFILING_STACK_V2_ENABLED` is set.

- Telemetry
  - Ensures that Telemetry heartbeats are not skipped for forked processes, as doing so could result in the dependency list being lost over time.

  - `botocore`: This fix resolves the issue where the span pointer for deserialized DynamoDB requests (through the resource-based API) were not being generated.
  - `botocore`: This fix resolves an issue where our span pointer calculation code added recently logged unactionable messages.
  - `celery`: This fix resolves two issues with context propagation in celery
    1.  Invalid span parentage when task A calls task B async and task A errors out, causing A's queuing of B, and B itself to not be parented under A.
    2.  Invalid context propagation from client to workers, and across retries, causing multiple traces instead of a single trace
  - `celery`: Changes celery `out.host` span tag to point towards broker host url instead of local celery process hostname. Fixes inferred service representation issues when using celery.
  - `grpcaio`: Resolves a concurrency bug where distributed tracing headers were overwritten resulting in spans being assigned to the wrong trace.
  - `kafka`: Fixes an issue with Kafka consumer spans not using the active trace context when distributed tracing was enabled and no valid distributed context found was found within a consumed message.


### Other Changes
- Tracing
  - Removed x-forwarded from headers used for client IP resolution (but not from collected headers). We lack evidence of actual usage, and whether this should follow RFC 7239 or regular XFF list format.

### New Features
- ASM
  - Support added for session fingerprints.

- LLM Observability
  - When not using a provider integration (OpenAI, Anthropic, or Bedrock) with the LangChain integration, token metrics will be appended to the LLM Observability `llm` span.
  - LLM Observability: When langchain's `chat_model.with_structured_output(..., method="json_mode")` is used, or `response_format={"type": "json_object"}` is passed into a langchain chat model invocation, the LLM Observability span will be an `llm` span instead of a `workflow` span.

### Bug Fixes
- ASM
  - The new user events policy is preventing users PII to be added by default as span tags. To allow customers using the Django auto instrumentation to still have those information, new environment variables have been added. In particular `DD_DJANGO_INCLUDE_EMAIL` (false by default), will tag user events with user email as before.

- Code Security/IAST
  - Adds `umap`, `numba` and `pynndescent` to the Code Security denylist.

  - Fixes an issue where enabling native exporter via `DD_PROFILING_EXPORT_LIBDD_ENABLED`, `DD_PROFILING_TIMELINE_ENABLED` or `DD_PROFILING_STACK_V2_ENABLED` turned off live heap profiling.
  - The lock profiler would log a warning if it couldn't determine a name for a lock, and it would try determining a name multiple times for the same lock. This lead to excessive log spam. Downgrade this to a debug log and only try to determine the name once.
  - Fixes an issue where the profiler was allocating too much memory from `ensure_binary_or_empty()` function, on Python versions before 3.12, with `DD_PROFILING_EXPORT_LIBDD_ENABLED` or `DD_PROFILING_TIMELINE_ENABLED`.
  - Fixes an issue where the sample pool could deadlock after `fork()` by clearing it in the child process.
  - When a Python thread finishes, this change frees memory used for mapping its thread id to `Span`. The mapping is populated and used when `DD_PROFILING_ENDPOINT_COLLECTION_ENABLED` and `DD_PROFILING_STACK_V2_ENABLED` were set to enable grouping of profiles for endpoints.

## 2.15.0

### New Features
- LLM Observability
  - Introduces `prompt` and `name` arguments to `LLMObs.annotation_context` to support setting an integration generated span's name and `prompt` field. For more information on annotation contexts, see the docs [here](https://docs.datadoghq.com/llm_observability/setup/sdk/#annotating-a-span).
  - langchain: Adds support for tracing `stream` calls on LCEL chains, chat completion models, or completion models. Note that due to an upstream issue with the `langchain` library itself, streamed responses will not be tagged correctly based on the choice index when the underlying model is configured to return `n>1` choices. Please refer to [this GitHub issue](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langchain/issues/26719) for more details.
  - LangChain streamed calls (`llm.stream`, `chat_model.stream`, and `chain.stream`) submit to LLM Observability.

- CI Visibility

### Bug Fixes
- Code security
  - Resolves an issue where partial matches on function names we aimed to patch were being patched instead of full matches on them.
  - Always report a telemetry log error when an IAST propagation error raises, regardless of whether the `_DD_IAST_DEBUG` environment variable is enabled or not.
  - Ensures that only the IAST propagation context is cleared instead of all contexts, which could otherwise cause propagation loss in multithreaded applications. Additionally, it improves validations in both the Processor and Vulnerability Reporter, depending on whether IAST is active or not.
  - Ensures IAST propagation does not raise side effects related to `re.finditer`.

- LLM Observability
  - Resolves an issue where `LLMObs.enable()` did not patch google_generativeai library.
  - botocore: Fixes the bedrock model and model provider interpretation from `modelId` when using cross-region inference.
  -  Resolves an issue where LLM Observability evaluation metrics were not being submitted in forked processes. The evaluation metric writer thread now automatically restarts when a forked process is detected.
  - The OpenAI, LangChain, Anthropic, Bedrock, and Gemini integrations now will handle and log errors during LLM Observability span processing to avoid disrupting user applications.

- Profiling
  - Improves the error message when the native exporter fails to load and stops profiling from starting if ddtrace is also being injected.
  - All files with platform-dependent code have had their filenames updated to reflect the platform they are for. This fixes issues where the wrong file would be used on a given platform.
  - Fixes endpoint profiling for stack v2, when `DD_PROFILING_STACK_V2_ENABLED` is set.
  - Fixes endpoint profiling when using libdatadog exporter, either with `DD_PROFILING_EXPORT_LIBDD_ENABLED` or `DD_PROFILING_TIMELINE_ENABLED`.

  - Fixes an issue where stack v2 couldn't be enabled as pthread was not properly linked on some debian based images for aarch64 architecture.
  - Fixes an issue where the flame graph was upside down for stack v2 with `DD_PROFILING_STACK_V2_ENABLED`.

- Tracing
  - elasticsearch: Resolves an issue where span tags were not fully populated on "sampled" spans, causing metric dimensions to be incorrect when spans were prematurely marked as sampled, including `resource_name`.
  - Resolves the issue where tracer flares would not be generated if unexpected types were received in the `AGENT_CONFIG` remote configuration product.
  - celery: Fixes an issue where `celery.apply` spans didn't close if the `after_task_publish` or `task_postrun` signals didn't get sent when using `apply_async`, which can happen if there is an internal exception during the handling of the task. This update also marks the span as an error if an exception occurs.
  - celery: Fixes an issue where `celery.apply` spans using task_protocol 1 didn't close by improving the check for the task id in the body.
  - Removes a reference cycle that caused unnecessary garbage collection for top-level spans.
  - Ensures that `http.url` span tag contains the full query string when `DD_TRACE_OBFUSCATION_QUERY_STRING_REGEXP` is set to an empty string.
  - Ensures `DD_TRACE_RATE_LIMIT` environment variable is only applied to spans for which tracer sampling is configured. For spans not matching sampling rules default rate limits should be applied by the Datadog Agent.

- Other
  - Updates import path in FastAPI module to use the new ASGI module location.

## 2.11.0

### New Features

- ASM: This update introduces new Auto User Events support.

  ASM’s \[Account TakeOver (ATO) detection\](<https://docs.datadoghq.com/security/account_takeover_protection>) is now automatically monitoring \[all compatible user authentication frameworks\](<https://docs.datadoghq.com/security/application_security/enabling/compatibility/>) to detect attempted or leaked user credentials during an ATO campaign.

  To do so, the monitoring of the user activity is extended to now collect all forms of user IDs, including non-numerical forms such as usernames or emails. This is configurable with 3 different working modes: <span class="title-ref">identification</span> to send the user IDs in clear text; <span class="title-ref">anonymization</span> to send anonymized user IDs; or <span class="title-ref">disabled</span> to completely turn off any type of user ID collection (which leads to the disablement of the ATO detection).

  The default collection mode being used is <span class="title-ref">identification</span> and this is configurable in your remote service configuration settings in the \[service catalog\]( <https://app.datadog.com/security/appsec/inventory/services?tab=capabilities>) (clicking on a service), or with the service environment variable <span class="title-ref">DD_APPSEC_AUTO_USER_INSTRUMENTATION_MODE</span>.

  You can read more \[here\](<https://docs.datadoghq.com/security/account_takeover_protection>).

  New local configuration environment variables include:

  - \`DD_APPSEC_AUTOMATED_USER_EVENTS_TRACKING_ENABLED\`: Can be set to "true"/"1" (default if missing) or "false"/"0" (default if set to any other value). If set to false, the feature is completely disabled. If enabled, the feature is active.
  - \`DD_APPSEC_AUTO_USER_INSTRUMENTATION_MODE\`: Can be set to "identification" (default if missing), "anonymization", or "disabled" (default if the environment variable is set to any other value). *The values can be modified via remote configuration if the feature is active*. If set to "disabled", user events are not collected. Otherwise, user events are collected, using either plain text user_id (in identification mode) or hashed user_id (in anonymization mode).

  Additionally, an optional argument for the public API <span class="title-ref">track_user_login_success_event</span> and \`track_user_login_failure_event\`: <span class="title-ref">login_events_mode="auto"</span>. This allows manual instrumentation to follow remote configuration settings, enabling or disabling manual instrumentation with a single remote action on the Datadog UI.

  Also prevents non numerical user ids to be reported by default without user instrumentation in Django.

- Anthropic: Adds support for tracing message calls using tools.

- LLM Observability: Adds support for tracing Anthropic messages using tool calls.

- botocore: Adds support for overriding the default service name in botocore by either setting the environment variable `DD_BOTOCORE_SERVICE` or configuring it via <span class="title-ref">ddtrace.config.botocore\["service"\]</span>.

- azure: Removes the restrictions on the tracer to only run the mini-agent on the consumption plan. The mini-agent now runs regardless of the hosting plan

- ASM: Adds Threat Monitoring support for gRPC.

- Code Security: add propagation for GRPC server sources.

- LLM Observability: This introduces improved support for capturing tool call responses from the OpenAI and Anthropic integrations.

- LLM Observability: This introduces the agentless mode configuration for LLM Observability. To enable agentless mode, set the environment variable `DD_LLMOBS_AGENTLESS_ENABLED=1`, or use the enable option `LLMObs.enable(agentless_enabled=True)`.

- LLM Observability: Function decorators now support tracing asynchronous functions.

- LLM Observability: This introduces automatic input/output annotation for task/tool/workflow/agent/retrieval spans traced by function decorators. Note that manual annotations for input/output values will override automatic annotations.

- LLM Observability: The OpenAI integration now submits embedding spans to LLM Observability.

- LLM Observability: All OpenAI model parameters specified in a completion/chat completion request are now captured.

- LLM Observability: This changes OpenAI-generated LLM Observability span names from `openai.request` to `openai.createCompletion`, `openai.createChatCompletion`, and `openai.createEmbedding` for completions, chat completions, and embeddings spans, respectively.

- LLM Observability: This introduces the agent proxy mode for LLM Observability. By default, LLM Observability spans will be sent to the Datadog agent and then forwarded to LLM Observability. To continue submitting data directly to LLM Observability without the Datadog agent, set `DD_LLMOBS_AGENTLESS_ENABLED=1` or set programmatically using `LLMObs.enable(agentless_enabled=True)`.

- LLM Observability: The Langchain integration now submits embedding spans to LLM Observability.

- LLM Observability: The `LLMObs.annotate()` method now replaces non-JSON serializable values with a placeholder string `[Unserializable object: <string representation of object>]` instead of rejecting the annotation entirely.

- pylibmc: adds traces for memcached add command

- ASM: This introduces fingerprinting with libddwaf 1.19.1

- Database Monitoring: Adds Database Monitoring (DBM) trace propagation for postgres databases used through Django.

- langchain: Tags tool calls on chat completions.

- LLM Observability: Adds retry logic to the agentless span writer to mitigate potential networking issues, like timeouts or dropped connections.

- ASM: This introduces Command Injection support for Exploit Prevention on os.system only.

- ASM: This introduces suspicious attacker blocking with libddwaf 1.19.1
### Upgrade Notes

- ASM: This upgrade prevents the WAF from being invoked for exploit prevention if the corresponding rules are not enabled via remote configuration.
### Deprecation Notes

- ASM: The environment variable DD_APPSEC_AUTOMATED_USER_EVENTS_TRACKING is deprecated and will be removed in the next major release. Instead of DD_APPSEC_AUTOMATED_USER_EVENTS_TRACKING, you should use DD_APPSEC_AUTO_USER_INSTRUMENTATION_MODE. The "safe" and "extended" modes are deprecated and have been replaced by "anonymization" and "identification", respectively.
- botocore: All methods in botocore/patch.py except `patch()` and `unpatch()` are deprecated and will be removed in version 3.0.0.
- consul: All methods in consul/patch.py except `patch()` and `unpatch()` are deprecated and will be removed in version 3.0.0.
- psycopg: All methods in psycopg/patch.py except `patch()` and `unpatch()` are deprecated and will be removed in version 3.0.0.
- pylibmc: All methods in pylibmc/patch.py except `patch()` and `unpatch()` are deprecated and will be removed in version 3.0.0.
- pymemcache: All methods in pymemcache/patch.py except `patch()` and `unpatch()` are deprecated and will be removed in version 3.0.0.

- exception replay: The `DD_EXCEPTION_DEBUGGING_ENABLED` environment variable has been deprecated in favor of `DD_EXCEPTION_REPLAY_ENABLED`. The old environment variable will be removed in a future major release.
- ASM: This removes the partial auto instrumentation of flask login. It was giving only partial and possibly confusing picture of the login activity. We recommend customers to switch to \[manual instrumentation\](<https://docs.datadoghq.com/security/application_security/threats/add-user-info/?tab=loginsuccess&code-lang=python#adding-business-logic-information-login-success-login-failure-any-business-logic-to-traces>).
### Bug Fixes

- LLM Observability: Fixes an issue in the OpenAI integration where integration metrics would still be submitted even if `LLMObs.enable(agentless_enabled=True)` was set.
- Code Security: add null pointer checks when creating new objects ids.

- celery: changes `error.message` span tag to no longer include the traceback that is already included in the `error.stack` span tag.
- CI Visibility: fixes source file information that would be incorrect in certain decorated / wrapped scenarios and forces paths to be relative to the repository root, if present.
- futures: Fixes inconsistent behavior with `concurrent.futures.ThreadPoolExecutor` context propagation by passing the current trace context instead of the currently active span to tasks. This prevents edge cases of disconnected spans when the task executes after the parent span has finished.
- kafka: Fixes `ArgumentError` raised when injecting span context into non-existent Kafka message headers.
- botocore: Fixes Botocore Kinesis span parenting to use active trace context if a propagated child context is not found instead of empty context.
- langchain: This fix resolves an issue where the wrong langchain class name was being used to check for Pinecone vectorstore instances.
- LLM Observability: This resolves a typing hint error in the `ddtrace.llmobs.utils.Documents` helper class constructor where type hints did not accept input dictionaries with integer or float values.
- LLM Observability: This fix resolves an issue where the OpenAI, Anthropic, and AWS Bedrock integrations were always setting `temperature` and `max_tokens` parameters to LLM invocations. The OpenAI integration in particular was setting the wrong `temperature` default values. These parameters are now only set if provided in the request.
- opentelemetry: Resolves circular imports raised by the OpenTelemetry API when the `ddcontextvars_context` entrypoint is loaded. This resolves an incompatibility introduced in `opentelemetry-api==1.25.0`.
- opentelemetry: Resolves an issue where the `get_tracer` function would raise a `TypeError` when called with the `attribute` argument. This resolves an incompatibility introduced in `opentelemetry-api==1.26.0`.

- profiling: Fixes an issue where task information coming from echion was encoded improperly, which could segfault the application.
- tracing: fixes a potential crash where using partial flushes and `tracer.configure()` could result in an IndexError
- tracer: This fix resolves an issue where the tracer was not starting properly on a read-only file system.
- internal: fixes an issue where some pathlib functions return OSError on Windows.
- ASM: This fix resolves an issue where the WAF could be disabled if the ASM_DD rule file was not found in Remote Config.
- flask: Fix scenarios when using flask-like frameworks would cause a crash because of patching issues on startup.
- Code Security: Logs warning instead of throwing an exception in the native module if IAST is not enabled by env var.
- Code Security: fix potential infinite loop with path traversal when the analyze quota has been exceeded.
- wsgi: Ensures the status of wsgi Spans are not set to error when a `StopIteration` exception is raised marked the span as an error. With this change, `StopIteration` exceptions in this context will be ignored.
- langchain: tag non-dict inputs to LCEL chains appropriately. Non-dict inputs are stringified, and dict inputs are tagged by key-value pairs.
- tracing: Updates `DD_HEADER_TAGS` and `DD_TAGS` to support the following formats: `key1,key2,key3`, `key1:val,key2:val,key3:val3`, `key1:val key2:val key3:val3`, and `key1 key2 key3`. Key value pairs that do not match an expected format will be logged and ignored by the tracer.
- loguru: This fix avoids copying attributes from a log record's "extras" field to the record's top level if those attributes were not added by the Datadog integration.
- opentelemetry: Resolves an edge case where distributed tracing headers could be generated before a sampling decision is made, resulting in dropped spans in downstream services.
- profiling: captures lock usages with `with` context managers, e.g. `with lock:`
- profiling: propagates `runtime_id` tag to libdatadog exporter. It is a unique string identifier for the profiled process. For example, Thread Timeline visualization uses it to distinguish different processes.
- profiling: show lock init location in Lock Name and hide profiler internal frames from Stack Frame in Timeline Details tab.
- ASM: This fix resolves an issue where ASM one click feature could fail to deactivate ASM.
- redis: This fix resolves an issue in redis utils where a variable may not be declared within a try/catch
### Other Changes

- LLM Observability: the SDK allowed users to submit an unsupported <span class="title-ref">numerical</span> evaluation metric type. All evaluation metric types submitted with <span class="title-ref">numerical</span> type will now be automatically converted to a <span class="title-ref">score</span> type. As an alternative to using the <span class="title-ref">numerical type, use \`score</span> instead.
- LLM Observability: `LLMObs.submit_evaluation()` requires a Datadog API key to send custom evaluations to LLM Observability. If an API key is not set using either `DD_API_KEY` or `LLMObs.enable(api_key="<api-key>")`, this method will log a warning and return `None`.

## 2.10.0

### New Features

- botocore: Adds support for overriding the default service name in botocore by either setting the environment variable `DD_BOTOCORE_SERVICE` or configuring it via `ddtrace.config.botocore["service"]`.

- Anthropic: Adds support for tracing synchronous and asynchronous message streaming.
- LLM Observability: Adds support for tracing synchronous and asynchronous message streaming.
- SSI: Introduces generic safeguards for automatic instrumentation when using single step install in the form of early exit conditions. Early exit from instrumentation is triggered if a version of software in the environment is not explicitly supported by ddtrace. The Python runtime itself and many Python packages are checked for explicit support on the basis of their version.
- langchain: Introduces support for `langchain==0.2.0` by conditionally patching the `langchain-community` module if available, which is an optional dependency for `langchain>=0.2.0`. See the langchain integration docs for more details.
- LLM Observability: Adds support to automatically submit Anthropic chat messages to LLM Observability.

- tracer: This introduces the tracer flare functionality. Currently the tracer flare includes the tracer logs and tracer configurations.

- Code Security: Expands SSRF vulnerability support for Code Security and Exploit Prevention for the modules `urllib3`, `http.client`, `webbrowser` and `urllib.request`.

- ASM: This introduces full support for exploit prevention in the python tracer.  
  - LFI (via standard API open)
  - SSRF (via standard API urllib or third party requests)

  with monitoring and blocking feature, telemetry and span metrics reports.

- ASM: This introduces SQL injection support for exploit prevention.

- anthropic: This introduces tracing support for anthropic chat messages.  
  See [the docs](https://ddtrace.readthedocs.io/en/stable/integrations.html#anthropic) for more information.

- ASM: This introduces "Standalone ASM", a feature that disables APM in the tracer but keeps ASM enabled. In order to enable it, set the environment variables `DD_APPSEC_ENABLED=1` and `DD_EXPERIMENTAL_APPSEC_STANDALONE_ENABLED=1`.

- LLM Observability: This introduces the LLM Observability SDK, which enhances the observability of Python-based LLM applications. See the [LLM Observability Overview](https://docs.datadoghq.com/tracing/llm_observability/) or the [SDK documentation](https://docs.datadoghq.com/tracing/llm_observability/sdk) for more information about this feature.

- opentelemetry: Adds support for span events.

- tracing: Ensures the following OpenTelemetry environment variables are mapped to an equivalent Datadog configuration (datadog environment variables taking precedence in cases where both are configured):

      OTEL_SERVICE_NAME -> DD_SERVICE
      OTEL_LOG_LEVEL -> DD_TRACE_DEBUG
      OTEL_PROPAGATORS -> DD_TRACE_PROPAGATION_STYLE
      OTEL_TRACES_SAMPLER -> DD_TRACE_SAMPLE_RATE

### Deprecation Notes

- Removes the deprecated sqlparse dependency.
- LLM Observability: `DD_LLMOBS_APP_NAME` is deprecated and will be removed in the next major version of ddtrace. As an alternative to `DD_LLMOBS_APP_NAME`, you can use `DD_LLMOBS_ML_APP` instead. See the [SDK setup documentation](https://docs.datadoghq.com/tracing/llm_observability/sdk/#setup) for more details on how to configure the LLM Observability SDK.

### Bug Fixes

- ASM: This fix resolves an issue where the requests integration would not propagate when apm is opted out (i.e. in ASM Standalone).
- profiling: Fixes an issue where task information coming from echion was encoded improperly, which could segfault the application.
- tracing: Fixes a potential crash where using partial flushes and `tracer.configure()` could result in an `IndexError`.
- flask: Fixes scenarios when using flask-like frameworks would cause a crash because of patching issues on startup.
- wsgi: Ensures the status of wsgi Spans are not set to error when a `StopIteration` exception is raised marked the span as an error. With this change, `StopIteration` exceptions in this context will be ignored.
- langchain: Tags non-dict inputs to LCEL chains appropriately. Non-dict inputs are stringified, and dict inputs are tagged by key-value pairs.
- langchain: Fixes an issue of langchain patching errors due to the `langchain-community` module becoming an optional dependency in `langchain>=0.2.0`. The langchain integration now conditionally patches `langchain-community` methods if it is available. See the langchain integration docs for more details.

- ASM: This fix resolves an issue where an org could not customize actions through remote config.
- ASM: Protects against potentially returning `None` when tainting a gRPC message.
- botocore: This fix adds additional key name checking and appropriate defaults for responses from Cohere and Amazon models.
- Tracer: This fix resolves an issue where importing `asyncio` after a trace has already been started will reset the currently active span.
- CI Visibility: Fixes traces that were not properly being sent in agentless mode, and were otherwise not properly attached to the test that started them
- grpc: Fixes a bug in the `grpc.aio` support specific to streaming responses.
- openai: This fix resolves an issue where specifying `n=None` for streamed chat completions resulted in a `TypeError`.
- openai: This fix removes patching for the edits and fine tunes endpoints, which have been removed from the OpenAI API.
- openai: This fix resolves an issue where streamed OpenAI responses raised errors when being used as context managers.
- tracing: Ensures span links generated by distributed tracing headers record the correct sampling decision.
- telemetry: This fix resolves an issue when using `pytest` + `gevent` where the telemetry writer was eager initialized by `pytest` entrypoints loading of our plugin causing a potential dead lock.
- tracing: Fixes an issue where `DD_TRACE_SPAN_TRACEBACK_MAX_SIZE` was not applied to exception tracebacks.
- Code Security: This fixes a bug in the AST patching process where `ImportError` exceptions were being caught, interfering with the proper application cycle if an `ImportError` was expected."
- Code Security: Ensure IAST propagation does not raise side effects related to Magic methods.
- Code Security: Fixes a potential memory corruption when the context was reset.
- langchain: This fix resolves an issue where specifying inputs as a keyword argument for batching on chains caused a crash.
- Code Security: Avoids calling terminate on the extend and join aspect when an exception is raised.
- tracing: Ensures spans are rate limited at the expected rate (100 spans per second by default). Previously long running spans would set the rate limiter to set an invalid window and this could cause the next trace to be dropped.
- RemoteConfig: This fix resolves an issue where remote config did not work for the tracer when using an agent that would add a flare item to the remote config payload. With this fix, the tracer will now correctly pull out the lib_config we need from the payload in order to implement remote config changes properly.
- opentelemetry: Records exceptions on spans in a manner that is consistent with the [otel specification](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/otel/trace/exceptions/#recording-an-exception)
- tracing: Ensures W3C tracecontext headers take precedence over all other header formats when incoming headers reference different spans in the same trace.

### Other Changes

- LLM Observability: The SDK allowed users to submit an unsupported `numerical` evaluation metric type. All evaluation metric types submitted with `numerical` type will now be automatically converted to a `score` type. As an alternative to using the `numerical` type, use `score` instead.

- lib-injection: Updates base Alpine image to 3.20.

- langchain: This fix resolves an issue where the wrong langchain class name was being used to check for Pinecone vectorstore instances.
- opentelemetry: Resolves circular imports raised by the OpenTelemetry API when the `ddcontextvars_context` entrypoint is loaded. This resolves an incompatibility introduced in `opentelemetry-api==1.25.0`.
- opentelemetry: Resolves an issue where the `get_tracer` function would raise a `TypeError` when called with the `attribute` argument. This resolves an incompatibility introduced in `opentelemetry-api==1.26.0`.
- redis: Resolves an issue in the `redis` exception handling where an `UnboundLocalError` was raised instead of the expected `BaseException`.
- Code Security: Logs warning instead of throwing an exception in the native module if IAST is not enabled by env var.
- langchain: Fixes an issue of `langchain` patching errors due to the `langchain-community` module becoming an optional dependency in `langchain>=0.2.0`. The `langchain` integration now conditionally patches `langchain-community` methods if it is available. See the langchain integration docs for more details.
- langchain: Resolves incompatibilities with langchain==0.2.0
- ASM: Resolves an issue where ASM one click feature could fail to deactivate ASM.

## 2.9.3


### Bug Fixes

- Code Security: Adds `encodings.idna` to the IAST patching denylist to avoid problems with gevent.
- Code Security: Adds the boto package to the IAST patching denylist.
- celery: Changes `error.message` span tag to no longer include the traceback that is already included in the `error.stack` span tag.
- CI Visibility: Fixes source file information that would be incorrect in certain decorated / wrapped scenarios, and forces paths to be relative to the repository root, if present.
- LLM Observability: Resolves a typing hint error in the `ddtrace.llmobs.utils.Documents` helper class constructor where type hints did not accept input dictionaries with integer or float values.
- LLM Observability: Resolves an issue where the OpenAI and AWS Bedrock integrations were always setting `temperature` and `max_tokens` parameters to LLM invocations. The OpenAI integration in particular was setting the wrong `temperature` default values. These parameters are now only set if provided in the request.
- profiling: Fixes an issue where task information coming from `echion` was encoded improperly, which could segfault the application.
- tracing: Fixes a potential crash where using partial flushes and `tracer.configure()` could result in an `IndexError`.
- internal: Fixes an issue where some `pathlib` functions return `OSError`g on Windows.
- flask: Fixes scenarios when using flask-like frameworks would cause a crash because of patching issues on startup.
- wsgi: Ensures the status of wsgi Spans are not set to error when a `StopIteration` exception is raised marked the span as an error. With this change, `StopIteration` exceptions in this context will be ignored.
- langchain: Tags non-dict inputs to LCEL chains appropriately. Non-dict inputs are stringified, and dict inputs are tagged by key-value pairs.

### Other Changes

- LLM Observability: The SDK allowed users to submit an unsupported `numerical` evaluation metric type. All evaluation metric types submitted with `numerical` type will now be automatically converted to a `score` type. As an alternative to using the `numerical` type, use `score` instead.


---

## 2.9.2


### Bug Fixes

- futures: Fixes inconsistent behavior with `concurrent.futures.ThreadPoolExecutor` context propagation by passing the current trace context instead of the currently active span to tasks. This prevents edge cases of disconnected spans when the task executes after the parent span has finished.

### Other Changes

- lib-injection: Updates base Alpine image to 3.20.


---

## 2.9.1


### Deprecation Notes

- Removes the deprecated sqlparse dependency.


---

## 2.9.0

### New Features

- LLM Observability: This introduces the LLM Observability SDK, which enhances the observability of Python-based LLM applications. See the [LLM Observability Overview](https://docs.datadoghq.com/tracing/llm_observability/) or the [SDK documentation](https://docs.datadoghq.com/tracing/llm_observability/sdk) for more information about this feature.
- ASM:  Application Security Management (ASM) introduces its new "Exploit Prevention" feature in public beta, a new type of in-app security monitoring that detects and blocks vulnerability exploits. This introduces full support for exploit prevention in the python tracer.  
  - LFI (via standard API open)
  - SSRF (via standard API urllib or third party requests)

  with monitoring and blocking features, telemetry, and span metrics reports.

- opentelemetry: Adds support for span events.

- tracing: Ensures the following OpenTelemetry environment variables are mapped to an equivalent Datadog configuration (datadog environment variables taking precedence in cases where both are configured):

      OTEL_SERVICE_NAME -> DD_SERVICE
      OTEL_LOG_LEVEL -> DD_TRACE_DEBUG
      OTEL_PROPAGATORS -> DD_TRACE_PROPAGATION_STYLE
      OTEL_TRACES_SAMPLER -> DD_TRACE_SAMPLE_RATE
      OTEL_TRACES_EXPORTER -> DD_TRACE_ENABLED
      OTEL_METRICS_EXPORTER -> DD_RUNTIME_METRICS_ENABLED
      OTEL_RESOURCE_ATTRIBUTES -> DD_TAGS
      OTEL_SDK_DISABLED -> DD_TRACE_OTEL_ENABLED

- otel: Adds support for generating Datadog trace metrics using OpenTelemetry instrumentations
- aiomysql, asyncpg, mysql, mysqldb, pymysql: Adds Database Monitoring (DBM) for remaining mysql and postgres integrations lacking support.
- (aiomysql, aiopg): Implements span service naming determination to be consistent with other database integrations.
- ASM: This introduces the capability to enable or disable SCA using the environment variable DD_APPSEC_SCA_ENABLED. By default this env var is unset and in that case it doesn't affect the product.
- Code Security: Taints strings from gRPC messages.
- botocore: This introduces tracing support for bedrock-runtime embedding operations.
- Vulnerability Management for Code-level (IAST): Enables IAST in the application. Needed to start application with `ddtrace-run [your-application-run-command]` prior to this release. Now, you can also activate IAST with the `patch_all` function.
- langchain: This adds tracing support for LCEL (LangChain Expression Language) chaining syntax. This change specifically adds synchronous and asynchronous tracing support for the `invoke` and `batch` methods.

### Known Issues

- Code Security: Security tracing for the `builtins.open` function is experimental and may not be stable. This aspect is not replaced by default.
- grpc: Tracing for the `grpc.aio` clients and servers is experimental and may not be stable. This integration is now disabled by default.

### Upgrade Notes

- aiopg: Upgrades supported versions to \>=1.2. Drops support for 0.x versions.

### Deprecation Notes

- LLM Observability: `DD_LLMOBS_APP_NAME` is deprecated and will be removed in the next major version of ddtrace. As an alternative to `DD_LLMOBS_APP_NAME`, you can use `DD_LLMOBS_ML_APP` instead. See the [SDK setup documentation](https://docs.datadoghq.com/tracing/llm_observability/sdk/#setup) for more details on how to configure the LLM Observability SDK.

## 2.8.0

### Prelude

tracing: This release adds support for lazy sampling, essentially moving when we make a sampling decision for a trace to the latest possible moment. These include the following: 1. Before encoding a trace chunk to be sent to the agent 2. Before making an outgoing request via HTTP, gRPC, or a DB call for any automatically instrumented integration 3. Before running `os.fork()` For most users this change shouldn't have any impact on their traces, but it does allow for more flexibility in sampling (see `features` release note). It should be noted that if a user has application egress points that are not automatically instrumented, to other Datadog components (downstream instrumented services, databases, or execution context changes), and rely on the Python tracer to make the sampling decision (don't have an upstream service doing this), they will need to manually run the sampler for those traces, or use `HttpPropagator.inject()`. For more information please see the following: <https://ddtrace.readthedocs.io/en/stable/advanced_usage.html#distributed-tracing> <https://ddtrace.readthedocs.io/en/stable/advanced_usage.html#tracing-context-management>

### New Features

- DSM: Adds base64 format for encoding and decoding DSM context hash.
- botocore: adds dsm payload size stats for botocore messaging services of kinesis, sqs and sns.
- botocore: Adds support to the bedrock integration for tagging input and output messages.
- langchain: This introduces support for `langchain==0.1.0`. Note that this does not have tracing support for deprecated langchain operations. Please follow the langchain upgrade [guide](https://python.langchain.com/docs/changelog/core) or the langchain integration :ref: <span class="title-ref">docs\<langchain\></span> to enable full tracing support.
- dramatiq: Adds automatic tracing of the `dramatiq` library.
- tracing: Added support for lazy sampling, the benefit of which is the ability to make a sampling decision using `DD_TRACE_SAMPLING_RULES` based on any span attribute (service, resource, tags, name)regardless of when the value for the attribute is set. This change is particularly beneficial for sampling on tags, since the vast majority of tags are set after the span is created. Since sampling was previously done at span creation time, this meant that those tags could not be used for sampling decisions.
- openai: Adds support for tagging streamed responses for completion and chat completion endpoints.
- profiling: implement an experimental stack sampling feature, which can be enabled by setting `DD_PROFILING_STACK_V2_ENABLED=true`. This new sampler should resolve segfault issues on Python 3.11 and later, while also decreasing the latency contribution of the profiler in many situations, and also improving the accuracy of stack-sampling data. This feature is currently only available on Linux using CPython 3.8 or greater. Requires `DD_PROFILING_EXPORT_LIBDD_ENABLED=true` to be set.
- botocore: Changes botocore aws kinesis contrib to set DSM pathway using extracted DSM context, if found, instead of always using a new pathway with default context.
- kafka: Adds tracing and DSM support for `confluent_kafka.Consumer.consume()`. Previously only <span class="title-ref">confluent_kafka.Consumer.poll</span> was instrumented.

### Deprecation Notes

- tracing: Deprecates support for `ddtrace.contrib.asyncio.AsyncioContextProvider`. ddtrace fully support tracing across asyncio tasks. Asyncio no longer requires additional configurations.
- tracing: `tracer.sampler` is deprecated and will be removed in the next major version release. To manually sample please call `tracer.sample` instead.
- gevent: Deprecates `ddtrace.contrib.gevent.provider.GeventContextProvider`. Drops support for <span class="title-ref">gevent\<20.12.0</span> and <span class="title-ref">greenlet\<1.0</span>.

### Bug Fixes

- Vulnerability Management for Code-level (IAST): Some native exceptions were not being caught correctly by the python tracer. This fix remove those exceptions to avoid fatal error executions.

- ASM: This fix resolves an issue where django login failure events may send wrong information of user existence.
- CI Visibility: fixes an issue where git author or committer names containing commas (eg: "Lastname, Firstname") would not work (and log an error) due to the use of comma as a separator.
- propagation: This fix resolves an issue where the sampling decision-maker tag in tracestate propagation headers was clobbered by a default value.
- datastreams: Changed DSM processor error logs to debug logs for a statement which is retried. If all retries fail, the stack trace is included
- internal telemetry: Ensures heartbeat events are sent at regular intervals even when no other events are being sent.
- Fix an incompatibility between the handling of namespace module imports and parts of the functionalities of the standard library importlib module.
- internal: This fix resolves an issue where importing the `ddtrace.appsec._iast._patches` module would fail raising an ImportError

- ASM: This fix resolves an issue where the asgi middleware could crash with a RuntimeError "Unexpected message received".
- ASM: This fix resolves an issue with Flask instrumentation causing CPU leak with ASM, API Security and Telemetry enabled.
- Vulnerability Management for Code-level (IAST): Addresses an issue where the IAST native module was imported even though IAST was not enabled.
- Vulnerability Management for Code-level (IAST): This fix addresses an issue where tainting objects may fail due to context not being created in the current span.
- Vulnerability Management for Code-level (IAST): This fix addresses an issue where AST patching would generate code that fails to compile, thereby preventing the application from starting correctly.
- Vulnerability Management for Code-level (IAST): This fix addresses AST patching issues where other subscript operations than `Load` were being unintentionally patched, leading to compilation errors for the patched module.
- Vulnerability Management for Code-level (IAST): Fixes an issue where an atexit handler could lead to a segmentation fault.
- Vulnerability Management for Code-level (IAST): This fix addresses an issue where a vulnerability would be reported at line 0 if we couldn't extract the proper line number, whereas the default line number should be -1.
- kafka: This fix resolves an issue where `None` messages from confluent-kafka could cause crashes in the Kafka integration.
- appsec: This fix resolves an issue in which the library attempted to finalize twice a context object used by the Application Security Management product.
- tracing: Removes `allow_false` argument from ddtrace samplers. `allow_false` allows datadog samplers to return a value that differs from the sampling decision, this behavior is not supported.
- profiling: This fixes a `free(): invalid pointer` error which would arise as a result of incorrectly linking the C++ runtime.
- starlette: Ensures correct URL tag is set for starlette v0.34.0 and above.
- structlog: Fixes error where multiple loggers would duplicate processors. Also adds processors injection when resetting to defaults.

### Upgrade Notes

- CI Visibility: `DD_CIVISIBILITY_ITR_ENABLED` now defaults to true, and the Datadog API (configured via the Datadog dashboard) now determines whether code coverage and test skipping are enabled.
- CI Visibility: the CI Visibility service is no longer enabled when the initial query to the Datadog test service settings API fails due to a 403 status code.

### New Features

- botocore: Adds optional feature to propagate context between producers and consumers for AWS SQS, AWS SNS, and AWS Kinesis via <span class="title-ref">DD_BOTOCORE_PROPAGATION_ENABLED</span> environment variable. Adds optional feature to disable tracing of AWS SQS <span class="title-ref">poll()</span> operation and AWS Kinesis 'get_records()' operation when no data is consumed via <span class="title-ref">DD_BOTOCORE_EMPTY_POLL_ENABLED</span> environment variable.

- tracing: Adds new tag <span class="title-ref">python_main_package</span> containing the name of the main package of the application. profiling: Adds new tag <span class="title-ref">python_main_package</span> containing the name of the main package of the application.

- starlette,fastapi: Trace background tasks using span links

### Bug Fixes

- ASM: This fix resolves an issue where an exception would be logged while parsing an empty body JSON request.

- CI Visibility: fixes an issue where coverage data for suites could be lost for long-running test sessions, reducing the possibility of skipping tests when using the Intelligent Test Runner.

- IAST: Don't split AST Assign nodes since it's not needed for propagation to work.

- ASM: This fix resolves an issue where suspicious request blocking on request data was preventing API Security to collect schemas in FastAPI, due to route not being computed.

- ASM: This fix resolves an issue where ASM custom blocking actions with a redirect action could cause the server to drop the response.

- Fixed an incompatible version requirements for one of the internal dependencies that could have caused an exception to be raised at runtime with Python 3.12.

- data_streams: This change fixes a bug leading to lag being reported as 1 offset instead of 0 offsets.

- IAST: fixes import overhead when IAST is disabled.

- Fix an incomplete support for pkg_resouces that could have caused an exception on start-up.

- Fix an issue that caused an exception to be raised when trying to access resource files via `pkg_resources`.

- Fix for an import issue that caused the pytest plugin to fail to properly initialize a test session and exit with an import exception.

- openai: This fixes a bug that prevents logs from being correlated with traces in the Datadog UI.

- langchain: This fixes a bug that prevents logs from being correlated with traces in the Datadog UI.

- openai: This fix resolves an issue where an internal OpenAI method <span class="title-ref">SyncAPIClient.\_process_response</span>
  was not being patched correctly and led to to an AttributeError while patching.

- profiling: handle a potential system error that may be raised when running a Celery-based application with CPython 3.11.

- Fixed an issue that could have caused an exception as a result of a concurrent access to some internal value cache.

- tracing: Ensures span links are serialized with the expected traceflag when `DD_TRACE_API_VERSION=v0.4`

- ASM: This fix resolves an issue where IP Headers configured by the user in the environment could not work for frameworks handling requests with case insensitive headers like FastAPI.

- Vulnerability Management for Code-level (IAST): Fixes a bug in the `str` aspect where encoding and errors arguments were not honored correctly.

- Vulnerability Management for Code-level (IAST): Fix an unhandled ValueError in `ast_function` thrown in some cases (i.e. Numpy arrays when converted to bool).

- opentelemetry: Ensures that span links are serialized in a json-compatible representation.

- Pin importlib_metadata to 6.5.0 to avoid its issue 455 (<https://github.com/python/importlib_metadata/issues/455>).

- profiler: Fixes a sigabrt when shutdown occurs during an upload

- otel: Ensures all otel sampling decisions are consistent with Datadog Spans. This prevents otel spans in a distributed trace from being sampled differently than Datadog spans in the same trace.

- tracing: Fix an issue where remote configuration values would not be reverted when unset in the UI.

- tracing: Ensures hostnames are reported in statsd metrics if `DD_TRACE_REPORT_HOSTNAME=True` (default value is `False`).

### Other Changes

- setup: pins the default macOS deployment target to 10.14.
- tracing: Updates the default value of `DD_TRACE_PROPAGATION_STYLE` from `tracecontext,datadog` to `datadog,tracecontext`. With this change w3c tracecontext headers will be parsed before datadog headers. This change is backwards compatible and should not affect existing users.

## v2.5.0

### New Features

- aiohttp: add <span class="title-ref">split_by_domain</span> config to split service name by domain
- CI Visibility: Adds code coverage lines covered tag for `pytest` and `unittest`.
- aiohttp: Adds http.route tag to `aiohttp.request` spans.
- bottle: Adds http.route tag to `bottle.request` spans.
- falcon: Adds http.route tag to `falcon.request` spans.
- molten: Adds http.route tag to `molten.request` spans.
- Adds distributed tracing for confluent-kafka integration. Distributed tracing connects Kafka consumer spans with Kafka producer spans within the same trace if a message is valid. To enable distributed tracing, set the configuration: `DD_KAFKA_DISTRIBUTED_TRACING_ENABLED=True` for both the consumer and producer service.
- ASM: This introduces (experimental) api security support for fastAPI. Flask and Django were already supported in 2.4.0. Support schema computation on all addresses (requests and responses) and scanner support for pii, credentials and payment data.
- CI Visibility: introduces a CI visibility-specific logger (enabled for the `pytest` plugin), enabled by setting the `DD_CIVISIBILITY_LOG_LEVEL` environment variable (with the same level names as Python logging levels).
- CI Visibility: allows for waiting for the git metadata upload to complete before deciding whether or not to enable coverage (based on API response).
- Further lazy loads telemetry_writer so that it is not running when explicitly disabled. Users must explicitly set "DD_INSTRUMENTATION_TELEMETRY_ENABLED=false".
- tracer: Add support for remotely configuring trace tags.

### Bug Fixes

- loguru: Ensures log correlation is enabled when the root logger is initialized. Previously, log correlation was only enabled when a new sink was added.
- Fix compatibility with other tools that try to infer the type of a Python object at runtime.
- tracing: Fixes a bug that prevents span links from being visualized in the Datadog UI.
- tracing: Resolves span encoding errors raised when span links do not contain expected types
- ASM: This fix resolves an issue where custom event boolean properties were not reported as <span class="title-ref">true</span> and <span class="title-ref">false</span> like other tracers but as <span class="title-ref">True</span> and <span class="title-ref">False</span>.
- Vulnerability Management for Code-level (IAST): Ensure that Cookies vulnerabilities report only the cookie name.
- langchain: This fix resolves an `get_openai_token_cost_for_model` import error in langhcain version 0.0.351 or later.
- ASM: This fix resolves an issue where IAST could cause circular dependency at startup.
- tracing: Ensures all fields in `ddtrace.context.Context` are picklable.
- pytest: This fix resolves an issue where the <span class="title-ref">--no-cov</span> flag did not take precedence over the <span class="title-ref">--cov</span> flag when deciding whether to report code coverage on spans.
- rq: Fixed a bug where the RQ integration would emit a warning when setting `job.status` span tag.

---

## v2.4.0

### Upgrade Notes

- <div id="remove-unsupported-pylons">

  This removes the `pylons` integration, which does not support Python 3.

  </div>

### Deprecation Notes

- aioredis: The aioredis integration is deprecated and will be removed in a future version. As an alternative to the aioredis integration, you can use the redis integration with redis\>=4.2.0.

### New Features

- ASM: dependency telemetry metrics now will only report dependencies actually in use (imported) and will also report new imported modules periodically.

- ASM: This introduces Threat Monitoring and Blocking on FastAPI.
  - IP Blocking and all input addresses are supported on requests and responses

  \- Custom Blocking This does not contain user blocking specific features yet.

- tracing: Introduces support for OpenTracing Baggage Items with HTTP Propagation. Enable this support by `DD_TRACE_PROPAGATION_HTTP_BAGGAGE_ENABLED=true`. The `Context._set_baggage_item` and `Context._get_baggage_item` internal methods are provided for manual modifications to the Baggage Items. These API changes are subject to change.

- dynamic instrumentation: Add support for more built-in container types, such as `defaultdict`, `frozenset`, `OrderedDict` and `Counter`.

- Vulnerability Management for Code-level (IAST): Adds Python 3.12 compatibility

- Optionally lazy loads and disables Instrumentation Telemetry. Users must explicitly set "DD_INSTRUMENTATION_TELEMETRY_ENABLED=false".

- tracer: Add support for remotely setting the trace sample rate from the Datadog UI. This functionality is enabled by default when using `ddtrace-run` and library injection. To enable it when using the library manually, use `ddtrace.config.enable_remote_config()`.

### Bug Fixes

- tracer: tag spans that have been sampled due to an Agent sampling configuration.
- lambda: This change disables the use of `multiprocessing.queue` in Lambda, because it is not supported in Lambda
- langchain: This fix resolves a crash that could occur during embedding when no embeddings are found.
- Fix a regression with the support for gevent that could have occurred if some products, like ASM, telemetry, were enabled.
- kafka: Resolves `TypeError` raised by serializing producers and deserializing consumers when the `message.key` tag is set on spans.
- dynamic instrumentation: Fix an issue that caused the instrumented application to fail to start if a non-standard module was imported.
- openai: This fix resolves an issue where tagging image inputs in the chat completions endpoint resulted in attribute errors.
- openai: This fix resolves an issue where requesting raw API responses from openai\>=1.0 resulted in attribute errors while tagging.
- profiling: Fix an issue that prevented threading locks from being traced when using gevent.
- profiling: Fix a segmentation fault with CPython 3.12 when sampling thread stacks.
- pylibmc: Fixes an issue where using `ddtrace-run` or `ddtrace.patch_all()` with `DD_TRACE_ENABLED=False` would break with get, gets, and get_multi operations on pylibmc Clients.
- tracing: This fix resolves an issue where concurrent mutations to the `context._meta` dict caused <span class="title-ref">RuntimeError: dictionary changed size during iteration</span>.
- django: Resolves `AttributeError` raised by traced `StreamingHttpResponse`.
- Vulnerability Management for Code-level (IAST): This fix resolves an issue where certain aspects incorrectly expected at least one argument, leading to an IndexError when none were provided. The solution removes this constraint and incorporates regression tests for stability assurance.
- Vulnerability Management for Code-level (IAST): Cookies vulnerabilities are only reported if response cookies are insecure.
- Vulnerability Management for Code-level (IAST): Fix propagation error on `.format` string method.
- requests: Updates the resource names of `requests.requests` spans to include the method and path of the request.
- propagation: This fix resolves an issue where a `Context` generated from extracted headers could lack a span_id or trace_id, leading `SpanLink` encoding errors.
- psycopg: This fix resolves an issue where a circular import of the psycopg library could cause a crash during monkeypatching.
- psycopg: This fix resolves an issue where exceptions originating from asynchronous Psycopg cursors were not propagated up the call stack.
- redis: This fix resolves an issue where the yaaredis and aredis integrations imported code from the redis integration, causing a circular import error.
- tracing: Resolves trace encoding errors raised when `DD_TRACE_API_VERSION` is set to `v0.5` and a BufferFull Exception is raised by the TraceWriter. This fix ensures span fields are not overwritten and reduces the frequency of 4XX errors in the trace agent.

### Other Changes

- tracing: Upgrades the trace encoding format to v0.5. This change improves the performance of encoding and sending spans.

---

## v2.3.0

### New Features

- propagation: 128-bit trace ids are now used by default for propagation. Previously the default was 64-bit. This change is backwards compatible with tracers that still use 64-bit trace ids and should not cause any breaking behavior.
- Adds DSM `pathway.hash` tag to spans when DSM is enabled. This allows traces from the instrumented service to show up in the DSM traces tab.
- propagation: When the tracer is configured to extract and inject `tracecontext`, the tracer will propagate the tracestate values from other vendors so long as the traceparent trace-id matches the first found trace context, regardless of propagator configuration order. To disable this behavior `DD_TRACE_PROPAGATION_EXTRACT_FIRST=true` can be set.
- opentelemetry: Map reserved OpenTelemetry attributes to Datadog span model.
- opentelemetry: datadog operation name from semantic conventions
- propagation: If a valid context is extracted from headers, and the following extracted trace context's `trace_id`s do not match the valid context's, then add a span link to the root span to represent the broken propagation.
- tracing: This change treats spans that terminated with `sys.exit(0)` as successful non-error spans.
- tracing: This introduces the `DD_TRACE_SPAN_TRACEBACK_MAX_SIZE` environment variable, allowing the maximum size of tracebacks included on spans to be configured.

### Bug Fixes

- CI Visibility: fixes the fact that the GITHUB_SERVER_URL environment variable was not being sanitized for credentials
- dynamic instrumentation: Needs to update the pubsub instance when the application forks because the probe mechanism should run in the child process. For that, DI needs the callback as the method of an instance of Debugger, which lives in the child process.
- CI Visibility: Fixes an issue where a `ValueError` was raised when using different path drives on Windows
- Fixes an issue where ddtrace could not be installed from source when using `setuptools>=69` due to a change in the license field.
- tracing: Fixes an issue where the thread responsible for sending traces is killed due to concurrent dictionary modification.
- structlog: Fixes `TypeError` raised when ddtrace log processor is configured with a tuple
- Vulnerability Management for Code-level (IAST): Generates cookies vulnerabilities report if IAST is enabled. Before this fix, Cookies vulnerabilities were only generated if both IAST and Appsec were enabled.
- Vulnerability Management for Code-level (IAST): This fix resolves an issue where, at AST patching to replace code with IAST aspects, passing the original function/method as an extra parameter for accurate patching unintentionally triggers side effects in methods obtained from an expression (like `decode` in `file.read(n).decode()`), resulting in unexpected multiple calls to the expression (`file.read(n)` in the example).
- Vulnerability Management for Code-level (IAST): This fix eliminates some reference leaks and C-API usage when IAST reports a vulnerability and calls `get_info_frame`.
- kafka: This fix resolves an issue where calls to `confluent_kafka`'s `produce` method with `key=None` would cause an exception to be raised.
- tracing: This fix resolves an issue where ddtrace's signal handlers could cause Flask apps not to respond correctly to SIGINT.
- logging: A log handler is automatically added to the ddtrace logger upon ddtrace import, when not using ddtrace-run. This can lead to duplicate logging if users add additional loggers and do not explicitly modify the ddtrace logger. This fix adds a feature flag that can be used to toggle this behavior off `DD_TRACE_LOG_STREAM_HANDLER` which defaults to `true`.

---

## v2.2.0

### Upgrade Notes

- The `wrapt` and `psutil` packages are vendored to help users avoid building these packages if wheels were not available for a given platform. This reverses a change released in v2.0.0.

### New Features

- CI Visibility: adds ITR support for `unittest`
- CI Visibility: adds start/end line support for `pytest` test spans
- CI Visibility: adds start/end line source file data to `unittest` test spans
- aiohttp: This introduces basic tracing of streaming responses that stay open long after the <span class="title-ref">on_prepare</span> signal has been sent.
- CI Visibility: introduce pytest hooks for modifying the module, suite, and test naming logic
- CI Visibility: add support for AWS Codepipeline to CI env var gathering
- datastreams: this change adds message payload size metrics and aggregations for Kafka.
- structlog: Wraps get_logger function in order to add datadog injection processor regardless of configuration
- openai: This adds support for openai v1.
- Source Code: filters Git repo URLs from env vars and setuptools
- logbook: This introduces log correlation for the logbook library. Refer to `logbook-docs <ddtrace.contrib.logbook>` for more details.
- loguru: This introduces log correlation for the loguru library. Refer to `loguru-docs <ddtrace.contrib.loguru>` for more details.
- openai: This adds support for tagging function call arguments when using OpenAI's function calling feature.
- Adds ARM64 support for Single-Step instrumentation
- structlog: This introduces log correlation for the structlog library. Refer to `structlog-docs <ddtrace.contrib.structlog>` for more details.
- celery: Adds Python 3.11 and 3.12 support for the celery integration.

### Known Issues

- ASM: fix a body read problem on some corner case where passing empty content length makes wsgi.input.read() blocks.

### Bug Fixes

- Application Security Management (ASM): fix a body read error when `Transfer-Encoding: chunked` header is sent
- CI Visibility: fixes an issue where class-based test methods with the same name across classes would be considered duplicates, and cause one (or more) tests to be dropped from results, by adding `--ddtrace-include-class-name` as an optional flag (defaulting to false) to prepend the class name to the test name.
- CI Visibility: fixes a crash where the unittest integration would try to enable coverage when tests are run even if the Intelligent Test Runner is not enabled.
- data_streams: This fix resolves an issue where tracing would crash if a kafka client produced a message with no key or value.
- CI: fixes an issue which prevented the library from filtering user credentials for SSH Git repository URLs
- dynamic instrumentation: fix an issue that caused function probes on the same module to fail to instrument and be reported in the `ERROR` status in the UI if the module was not yet imported.
- Use a unique default service name across all the products provided by the library when one is not given via the configuration interface.
- sampling: This fix reverts a refactor which affected how the tracer handled the trace-agent's recommended trace sampling rates, leading to an unintended increase in traces sampled.
- tracing: Fixes a msgpack import error when `DD_TRACE_API` is set to `v0.5`
- fix(profiling): numeric type exception in memalloc When pushing allocation samples, an exception was being thrown due to a float being passed instead of an integer. We now cast the ceiled value to an integer.
- CI Visibility: fixes `unittest` data not being initialized properly
- CI Visibility: fixes an issue where just importing <span class="title-ref">unittest</span> enabled CIVisibility and potentially caused unexpected logs and API requests
- Vulnerability Management for Code-level (IAST): This fix addresses AST patching issues where custom functions or methods could be replaced by aspects with differing argument numbers, causing runtime errors as a result. Furthermore, it addresses a case during patching where the module is inadvertently passed as the first argument to the aspect.
- Vulnerability Management for Code-level (IAST): Fix potential string id collisions that could cause false positives with non tainted objects being marked as tainted.
- IAST: This fix resolves an issue where JSON encoder would throw an exception while encoding a tainted dict or list.
- Vulnerability Management for Code-level (IAST): This fix resolves an issue where SimpleJSON encoder would throw an exception while encoding a tainted dict or list.
- ASM: add support for psycopg2 adapt mechanism to LazyTaintList, preventing a ProgrammingError when using psycopg2 with IAST.
- tracing: This fix resolves an issue where unserializable tracer attributes caused crashes when `DD_TRACE_DEBUG` was set.
- This fix resolves an issue where `confluent_kafka`'s `SerializingProducer` and `DeserializingConsumer` classes were incorrectly patched, causing crashes when these classes are in use with Datadog patching.
- langchain: This fix resolves an issue with tagging pydantic <span class="title-ref">SecretStr</span> type api keys.
- lib injection: Fix permissions error raised when non-root users copy single step instrumentation files.
- redis: The Datadog Agent removes command arguments from the resource name. However there are cases, like compressed keys, where this obfuscation cannot correctly remove command arguments. To safeguard that situation, the resource name set by the tracer will only be the command (e.g. SET) with no arguments. To retain the previous behavior and keep arguments in the span resource, with the potential risk of some command arguments not being fully obfuscated, set `DD_REDIS_RESOURCE_ONLY_COMMAND=false`.

### Other Changes

- tags: Previously `DD_TRACE_X_DATADOG_TAGS_MAX_LENGTH` had a max limit setting of 512 characters. This change removes that limit but keeps the default at 512.

---

## v2.0.0

### Prelude

The Datadog APM Python team is happy to announce the release of v2.0.0 of ddtrace. This release drops support for Python 2.7, 3.5, and 3.6. This release adds support for Python 3.12.

<div class="important">

<div class="title">

Important

If you are on version of Python not supported by v2, we will continue to maintain the ddtrace v1 with bug fixes.

</div>

<div class="note">

<div class="title">

Note

</div>

Before upgrading to v2.0.0, we recommend users install `ddtrace~=1.20.0` and enable deprecation warnings. All removals to the library interface and environment variables in v2 were deprecated in the 1.x release line.

#### Upgrading summary

##### Functionality changes

The default logging configuration functionality of ddtrace has been changed to avoid conflicting with application logging configurations. `DD_CALL_BASIC_CONFIG` has been removed and the ddtrace logger will log to stdout by default, or a log file as specified using `DD_TRACE_LOG_FILE`.

Setting the environment variable `DD_TRACE_PROPAGATION_STYLE='b3'`, which previously enabled `b3multi` now enables `b3 single header`. `b3 single header` still works but is deprecated for `b3`. Simplified: `b3` used to enable `b3multi`, but now enables `b3 single header` to better align with Opentelemetry's terms.

##### Removed deprecated environment variables

These environment variables have been removed. In all cases the same functionality is provided by other environment variables and replacements are provided as recommended actions for upgrading.

| Variable                                   | Replacement                                | Note                                                |
|--------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| `DD_GEVENT_PATCH_ALL`                      | None                                       | `📝<remove-dd-gevent-patch-all>`                    |
| `DD_AWS_TAG_ALL_PARAMS`                    | None                                       | `📝<remove-aws-tag-all-params>`                     |

| `DD_CALL_BASIC_CONFIG`                     | None                                       | `📝<remove-basic-config>`                           |
| `DD_TRACE_OBFUSCATION_QUERY_STRING_PATERN` | `DD_TRACE_OBFUSCATION_QUERY_STRING_REGEXP` | `📝<remove-trace-obfuscation-query-string-pattern>` |

##### Removed deprecated library interfaces

These methods and module attributes have been removed. Where the same functionality is provided by a different public method or module attribute, a recommended action is provided for upgrading. In a few limited cases, because the interface was no longer used or had been moved to the internal interface, it was removed and so no action is provided for upgrading.

  `DD_GEVENT_PATCH_ALL` is removed. There is no special configuration necessary to make ddtrace work with gevent if using ddtrace-run.

  </div>

- <div id="remove-aws-tag-all-params">

  `DD_AWS_TAG_ALL_PARAMS` is removed. The boto/botocore/aiobotocore integrations no longer collect all API parameters by default.

  </div>

### New Features

- Adds support for Python 3.12.

### Known Issues

- aiohttp: Python 3.12 is not supported.
- aiohttp-jinja: Python 3.12 is not supported.
- aiobotocore: Python 3.12 is not supported.
- asm: IAST for Python 3.12 is not supported.
- flask-caching: Python 3.12 is not supported.
- openai/langchain: Python 3.12 is not supported.
- opentelemetry-api: Python 3.12 is not supported.
- opentracing: Python 3.12 is not supported.
- pyramid: Python 3.12 is not supported.
- pynamodb: Python 3.12 is not supported.
- redis/redis-py-cluster: Python 3.12 is not supported.

---

## v1.20.0

### Prelude

Vulnerability Management for Code-level (IAST) is now available in private beta. Use the environment variable `DD_IAST_ENABLED=True` to enable this feature.

### New Features

- ASM: This introduces support for custom blocking actions of type redirect_request.
- data_streams: Adds public api `set_produce_checkpoint` and `set_consume_checkpoint`

### Bug Fixes

- kafka: Resolves an issue where traced kafka connections were assigned a default timeout of 1 second. The default timeout in [Consumer.poll(...)](https://docs.confluent.io/platform/current/clients/confluent-kafka-python/html/index.html#confluent_kafka.Consumer.poll) should be None.
- openai: This fix resolves an issue where errors during streamed requests resulted in unfinished spans.

---

## v1.19.0

### New Features

- Adds the <span class="title-ref">db.row_count</span> tag to redis and other redis-like integrations. The tag represents the number of returned results.
- CI Visibility: adds test level visibility for [unittest](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html)
- ASM: Adds detection of insecure cookie vulnerabilities on responses.
- ASM: This introduces trusted IPs capabilities in the tracer, to allow specific IPs not to be blocked by ASM but still be monitored.
- ASM: This introduces a new capability to configure the blocking response of ASM. Users can change the default blocking response behavior or create new custom actions. Configuration of a custom blocking page or payload can still be provided by using <span class="title-ref">DD_APPSEC_HTTP_BLOCKED_TEMPLATE_JSON</span> and <span class="title-ref">DD_APPSEC_HTTP_BLOCKED_TEMPLATE_HTML</span> to change the static files used for the response body. The action block, that can be defined in the static rule file or via remote configuration, allows now to create new custom blocking actions with any status code for the response.
- The aiopg and aiomysql integrations no longer set the sql.query tag on query spans. This tag duplicated the value captured by the span resource. Users who want to send this query unobfuscated can use the tracer API to set tags on the query span.
- data_streams: Starts tracking Kafka lag in seconds.
- kafka: Adds support for the Kafka serializing producer and deserializing consumer.
- profiling: allow individual collectors to be disabled.
- tracing: This change introduces the `allow_false` keyword argument to `BaseSampler.sample()`, which defaults to `True`. `allow_false` controls the function's return value. If `allow_false` is `False`, the function will always return `True` regardless of the sampling decision it made. This is useful when `sample` is called only for its side effects, which can include setting span tags.

### Known Issues

- There are known issues configuring python's builtin multiprocessing library when ddtrace is installed. To use the multiprocessing library with ddtrace ensure `DD_UNLOAD_MODULES_FROM_SITECUSTOMIZE` is set to `True`.
- When running setup.py extensions with the CMake parameter "-j", it could potentially raise an out-of-memory error. If someone wants to expedite the ddtrace installation, they should manually set the "CMAKE_BUILD_PARALLEL_LEVEL" environment variable.

### Bug Fixes

- ASM: avoid potentially unneeded import of the IAST native module.

- ASM: avoid potentially unneeded import of the IAST native module if setup doesn't build extensions correctly.

- data_streams: This fix resolves an issue where data stream context propagation would not propagate via SNS if raw message delivery was enabled.

- dynamic instrumentation: function duration measurements are now reported in milliseconds to match the expectation from the UI.

- dynamic instrumentation: fixed an issue that prevented line probes from being injected in some finally blocks.

- dynamic instrumentation: Fixed the programmatic API to ensure that the dynamic instrumentation service is fully enabled when `Dynamic Instrumentation.enable()` is called.

- dynamic instrumentation: fixed a bug that might have caused probe status to fail to update correctly.

- django: This fix resolves an issue where 'span.resource' would not include the endpoint when a Handler was interrupted, such as in the case of gunicorn worker timeouts.

- CI Visibility: fixes an issue where the Intelligent Test Runner would not work when in EVP proxy mode due to missing `X-Datadog-NeedsAppKey` header.

- CI Visibility: revert to using DD_CIVISIBILITY_ITR_ENABLED (instead of \_DISABLED) to conform with other tracers.

- profiling: fixed a bug that prevented profiles from being correctly correlated to traces in gevent-based applications, thus causing code hotspot and end point data to be missing from the UI.

- docs: Fix undefined variable reference in otel documentation

- CI Visibility: fixes that Python 2.7 test results were not visible in UI due to improperly msgpack-ed data

- ASM: This fix resolves an issue where <span class="title-ref">track_user_signup_event</span> and <span class="title-ref">track_custom_event</span> where not correctly tagging the span. This could lead to the loss of some events in the sampling.

- appsec: Fixes an issue where ddtrace.appsec is imported and assumed to be available in all deployments of ddtrace

- lib-inject: This fix resolves an issue where `libdl.so.2: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory` errors occurred when the
  injection image started.

- lib-injection: Resolves permissions errors raised when ddtrace packages are copied from the InitContainer to the shared volume.

- mariadb: This fix resolves an issue where MariaDB connection information objects not including the user or port caused exceptions to be raised.

- appsec: This fix resolves an issue in which the library attempted to finalize twice a context object used by the Application Security Management product.

- propagation: Prevent propagating unsupported non-ascii `origin` header values.

- pymongo: This upgrades the PyMongo integration to work with PyMongo versions 4.5.0 and above by choosing the root function of the integration on the basis of the PyMongo version.

- tracing: This fix resolves an issue where the <span class="title-ref">\_dd.p.dm</span> and <span class="title-ref">\_dd.\*\_psr</span> tags were applied to spans in ways that did not match their intended semantics, increasing the potential for metrics-counting bugs.

- ASM: This fix resolves issue where user information was only set in root span. Now span for user information can be selected.

- sqlalchemy: sqlalchemy rollbacks could previously cause intermittent deadlocks in some cases. To fix this `DD_TRACE_SPAN_AGGREGATOR_RLOCK` was introduced in 1.16.2 with the default as `False`. We are now changing the default to `True`.

### Other Changes

- Adds a <span class="title-ref">get_version</span> method to each integration and updates the basic template for developing an integration to include this method. The <span class="title-ref">get_version</span> method returns the integration's package distribution version and is to be included in the APM Telemetry integrations payload.
- Add a <span class="title-ref">ddtrace_iast_flask_patch</span> function defined in <span class="title-ref">ddtrace.appsec.iast</span> to ensure that the main Flask <span class="title-ref">app.py</span> file is patched for IAST propagation. This function should be called before the <span class="title-ref">app.run()</span> call. You only need this if you have set <span class="title-ref">DD_IAST_ENABLED=1</span>. Only the main file needs to call this functions, other imported modules are automatically patched.
- docs: Fixes formatting in ddtrace docs.
- ASM: Improve default value of regex for query string obfuscation. Rename env var `DD_TRACE_OBFUSCATION_QUERY_STRING_PATTERN` to `DD_TRACE_OBFUSCATION_QUERY_STRING_REGEXP`.

---

## v1.18.0

### Prelude

Data Streams Monitoring (DSM) has added support for AWS Kinesis

**Breaking change** for CI Visibility: `test.suite` and `test.full_name` are changed, so any visualization or monitor that uses these fields is potentially affected.

### Deprecation Notes

- `DD_CALL_BASIC_CONFIG` will be removed in the upcoming 2.0.0 release. As an alternative to `DD_CALL_BASIC_CONFIG`, you can call `logging.basicConfig()` to configure logging in your application.
- `DD_LOG_FORMAT` is deprecated and will be removed in 2.0.0. As an alternative, please follow the log injection formatting as provided in the [log injection docs](https://ddtrace.readthedocs.io/en/stable/advanced_usage.html#update-log-format).

### New Features

- CI Visibility: added tracing support for pytest-benchmark

- ASM: The vulnerability report now includes a feature to scrub potentially sensitive information. This scrubbing process looks for common patterns, and it can be further expanded using environment variables such as `DD_IAST_REDACTION_NAME_PATTERN` and `DD_IAST_REDACTION_VALUE_PATTERN`. See the [docs](https://ddtrace.readthedocs.io/en/stable/configuration.html#DD_IAST_REDACTION_ENABLED) for more information.

- DSM: Adds DSM support for AWS Kinesis. For information about DSM, see the [official documentation](https://docs.datadoghq.com/data_streams/). This change requires users to use botocore version 1.26.30 or later and update calls to Kinesis' <span class="title-ref">PutRecord</span>, <span class="title-ref">PutRecords</span>, and <span class="title-ref">GetRecords</span> calls with the StreamARN argument.

- pytest: This change introduces an option to the pytest plugin to disable ddtrace: `--no-ddtrace`

- CI visibility: Adds support for tracking repository URLs via the BITBUCKET_GIT_HTTP_ORIGIN environment variable

- CI visibility: Adds CodeFresh integration

- CI Visibility: Beta release of `pytest` support for the [Intelligent Test Runner](https://docs.datadoghq.com/continuous_integration/intelligent_test_runner/) .

- openai: `tiktoken` has been introduced as an optional package dependency to calculate the number of
  tokens used in a prompt for a streamed completion or streamed chat completion. To enable this feature, install `ddtrace[openai]` or `tiktoken`. If `tiktoken` is not installed, the prompt token count will be continue to be estimated instead.

- Allows the use of a new backend for storing and exporting profiling data. This feature can be enabled for now by setting the DD_PROFILING_EXPORT_LIBDD_ENABLED environment variable to true. This should improve performance while decreasing memory overhead.

### Known Issues

- sqlalchemy: sqlalchemy rollbacks can intermittently cause deadlocks in some cases. If experiencing this issue, set `DD_TRACE_SPAN_AGGREGATOR_RLOCK=True`. After testing and feedback we intend to make True the default value.

### Bug Fixes

- CI Visibility: fixes an issue where the CIVisibility client would raise an exception if it was started in agentless mode without the DD_API_KEY set

- core: This fix moves `cmake` from `install_requires` to `setup_requires`.

- data_streams: This change fixes a bug in the Kafka & SQS integrations in which the Data Streams product code incorrect set timestamps for statistics. This led to all points being submitted for the same timestamp (the start of the application).

- dynamic instrumentation: handle null literal in conditions and expressions.

- dynamic instrumentation: fixed a bug that prevented span decoration probes from being received and instrumented.

- dynamic instrumentation: ensure that probes that fail to be instrumented because of invalid conditions/expressions are reported with status `ERROR` in the UI.

- CI Visibility: This fix solves an issue where the git unshallow command wasn't called

- tracing: Ensures health metrics are tagged with the correct values.

- CI Visibility: This fix resolves an issue where test skipping was not working properly.

- langchain: This fix resolves an issue where chat messages and embedding arguments
  passed in as keyword arguments were not parsed correctly and resulted in an `ArgumentError`.

- langchain: This fix resolves an issue where `langchain.embeddings.HuggingFaceEmbeddings` embedding
  methods, and `langchain.vectorstores.Milvus.similarity_search` were patched twice due to a nested class hierarchy in `langchain`.

- profiling: prevent deadlocks while recording events of different type.

- pytest: This fix resolves an issue where test modules could be non-existent, causing errors in the CI Visibility product.

- kafka: Resolves `UnicodeDecodeError` raised when kafka messages key contain characters that are not supported by UTF-8 encoding.

- lib-injection: Adds support for non-root run applications in containers.

- This fix resolves an issue causing span tags used by the Datadog backend not to be inherited by spans that exist in a different process from their parents.

### Other Changes

- tracing: Previously the maximum size of a span tag was set to the full size of trace writer buffer (via DD_TRACE_WRITER_BUFFER_SIZE_BYTES). With this change the maximum size of span tags will be set to 10% of the size of the writer's buffer. This should decrease the frequency of encoding errors due to large span tags.

---

## v1.17.0

### Prelude

Datadog has added support for automatically creating login success or failure events when a configured Django authentication backend is used. This will automatically fill the following tags in these cases:

> - <span class="title-ref">appsec.events.users.login.success.track</span>
> - <span class="title-ref">appsec.events.users.login.failure.track</span>
> - <span class="title-ref">appsec.events.users.login.success.\[email\|login\|username\]</span>
> - <span class="title-ref">appsec.events.users.login.failure.usr.exists</span>

### New Features

- ASM: Add support for automatic user login events in Django.

- langchain: Adds integration with support for metrics, logs, and traces from LangChain requests.
  See the `docs<langchain>` for more information.

- redis: Add support for Async RedisCluster.

### Bug Fixes

- core: This fix removes the inclusion of our `benchmarks/` directory in the `ddtrace` wheels.
- internal: call `_fixupChildren` when retrieving `DDLogger`
- profiling: Fixed a regression whereby the profile exporter would not handle known request errors and asks the user to report an issue instead.
- profiling: Handles a race condition, which would occasionally throw an error, which would read `"RuntimeError: the memalloc module was not started."`
- CI visibility: fix version and step arguments gathering to enable plugin compatibility with pytest-bdd 6.1.x
- Fixed a bug that caused applications using gevent and cassandra to fail to start with the ddtrace-run command.
- tracing: This fix resolves a `google.protobuf` import error when module unloading.
- wsgi: This fix resolves an issues when trying to parse the `environ` property `HTTPS` as an HTTP header.
- Pin `cython<3` due to an incompatibility with `cython==3.0.0` and typing annotations in profiling code.
- telemetry: resolves issue with sending unnecessary duplicate logs

---

## v1.16.0

### Prelude

Application Security Management (ASM) has added support for tracing subprocess executions.

Exception Debugging allows capturing debug information from exceptions attached to traces. The information about local variables and function arguments is displayed in the Error Tracking UI and augments the traceback data already collected.

### New Features

- ASM: vulnerabilities related to insecure request cookies will be reported when `DD_APPSEC_ENABLED` is set to `true`.

- ASM: add support for tracing subprocess executions (like <span class="title-ref">os.system</span>, <span class="title-ref">os.spawn</span>, <span class="title-ref">subprocess.Popen</span> and others) and adding
  information to a span names <span class="title-ref">command_execution</span> with the new type <span class="title-ref">system</span>. Currently we add the <span class="title-ref">cmd.exec</span> or <span class="title-ref">cmd.shell</span> tags to store the full command line (<span class="title-ref">cmd.shell</span> will be used when the command is run under a shell like with <span class="title-ref">os.system</span> or <span class="title-ref">Popen</span> with <span class="title-ref">shell=True</span>), <span class="title-ref">cmd.exit_code</span> to hold the return code when available, <span class="title-ref">component</span> which will hold the Python module used and the span <span class="title-ref">resource</span> will hold the binary used. This feature requires ASM to be activated using the <span class="title-ref">DD_APPSEC_ENABLED=True</span> configuration environment variable.

- botocore: Introduces environment variable `DD_BOTOCORE_INSTRUMENT_INTERNALS` that opts into tracing certain internal functionality.

- botocore: Added message attributes to Amazon Simple Queue Service spans to support data streams monitoring.

- exception debugging: Introduced the Exception Debugging feature that allows capturing debug information from exceptions attached to traces. This new feature can be enabled via the <span class="title-ref">DD_EXCEPTION_DEBUGGING_ENABLED</span>\` environment variable.

- openai: Adds support for metrics, logs, and traces for the models, edits, images, audio, files, fine-tunes, and
  moderations endpoints. See [the docs](https://ddtrace.readthedocs.io/en/stable/integrations.html#openai) for more information.

- CI Visibility: Updates how pytest modules and test suites are reported. Modules names are now set to the fully qualified name, whereas test suites will be set to the file name.
  Before this change: {"module": "tests", "suite":"my_module/tests/test_suite.py"} After this change: {"module": "my_module.tests", "suite": "test_suite.py"}

- core: Apply `DD_TAGS` to runtime metrics.

- kafka: Adds <span class="title-ref">messaging.kafka.bootstrap.servers</span> tag for the confluent-kafka producer configuration value found in <span class="title-ref">metadata.broker.list</span> or <span class="title-ref">bootstrap.servers</span>

- tracing: This reports the GRPC package name (optional) and service name in a single <span class="title-ref">rpc.service</span> tag

### Bug Fixes

- botocore: This fix resolves an issue where ddtrace attempted to parse as URLs SQS QueueUrl attributes that were not well-formed URLs.
- psycopg: Resolves `TypeError` raised when an async cursor object is traced. This fix ensures <span class="title-ref">exc_type</span>, <span class="title-ref">exc_val</span>, and <span class="title-ref">exc_tb</span> are passed down to the wrapped object on <span class="title-ref">\_\_aexit\_\_</span>.
- Fixed an issue that prevented the library from working as expected when a combination of gevent and asyncio-based frameworks that rely on the functionalities of the ssl module is used.
- openai: Fixes the issue with `ImportError` of `TypedDict` from `typing` module in Python 3.7.
- openai: This fix resolves an issue where embeddings inputs were always tagged regardless of the configured prompt-completion sample rate.
- pytest: This fix resolves an issue where failures and non-skipped tests were not propagated properly when `unittest.TestCase` classes were used.
- Fixes an issue where harvesting runtime metrics on certain managed environments, such as Google Cloud Run, would cause ddtrace to throw an exception.
- graphql: `graphql.execute` spans are now marked as measured.
- tracing: This fix resolves an issue where negative trace ID values were allowed to propagate via Datadog distributed tracing HTTP headers.
- openai: Resolves some inconsistencies in logs generated by the image and audio endpoints, including filenames, prompts, and not logging raw binary image data.
- pymemcache: This fix resolves an issue where overriding span attributes on `HashClient` failed when `use_pooling` was set.
- This fix resolves an issue causing MyPy linting to fail on files that import ddtrace.
- The 1.15.0 version has a bug that arises when Remote Config receives both kinds of actions (removing target file configurations and loading new target file configurations) simultaneously, as the load action overrides the remove action. This error occurs if someone creates and removes Dynamic Instrumentation Probes rapidly, within a time interval shorter than the Remote Config interval (5s). To fix this issue, this update appends all new configurations and configurations to remove, and dispatches them at the end of the RC request.

---

## v1.15.0

### New Features

- pyramid: Adds http.route tag to `pyramid.request` spans.
- data_streams: Add data streams core integration and instrument the confluent Kafka library with it. For more information, check out the docs, <https://docs.datadoghq.com/data_streams/>
- dynamic instrumentation: Added support for span decoration probes.

### Bug Fixes

- ASM: This fix resolves an issue where the WAF rule file specified by DD_APPSEC_RULES was wrongly updated and modified by remote config.
- celery: Resolves an issue where hostname tags were not set in spans generated by `celery>4.0`.
- django: Resolves an issue where the resource name of django.request span did not contain the full name of a view when `DD_DJANGO_USE_HANDLER_RESOURCE_FORMAT=True`. This issue impacts `django>=4.0`.
- CI Visibility: This fix resolves the compatibility for Gitlab 16.0 deprecated urls
- openai: Resolves an issue where using an array of tokens or an array of token arrays for the Embeddings endpoint caused an AttributeError.
- profiling: Fixed an issue with gunicorn and gevent workers that occasionally caused an `AttributeError` exception to be raised on profiler start-up.
- psycopg: Fixes `ValueError` raised when dsn connection strings are parsed. This was fixed in ddtrace v1.9.0 and was re-introduced in v1.13.0.
- gunicorn: This fix ensures ddtrace threads do not block the master process from spawning workers when `DD_TRACE_DEBUG=true`. This issue impacts gunicorn applications using gevent and `python<=3.6`.

---

## v1.14.0

### Prelude

profiling: Code provenance is a feature that enhances the "My code" experience in the Datadog UI by allowing the tracer to report packaging metadata about installed source files. This information is used to distinguish between user and third-party code.

### New Features

- aws: Adds span tags for consistency with tags collected by Datadog for AWS metrics and logs.

- botocore: Adds the ability to control which botocore submodules will be patched.

- ASM: Send WAF metrics over telemetry

- pytest: This introduces test suite and module level visibility for the pytest integration. Pytest test traces will now include test session, test module, test suite, and test spans, which correlate to pytest session, pytest package, pytest module, and pytest test functions respectively.

- redis: Introducing redis command span tag max length configuration for `aioredis<aioredis>`, `aredis<aredis>`, `redis<redis>`, `rediscluster<rediscluster>`, and `yaaredis<yaaredis>` integrations.

- profiling: Code provenance is enabled by default.

- OpenAI: Add integration with support for metrics, logs and traces from
  OpenAI requests. See [the docs](https://ddtrace.readthedocs.io/en/stable/integrations.html#openai) for more information.

### Bug Fixes

- dependencies: Resolves an issue where ddtrace installs an incompatible version of cattrs when Python 3.6 is used.

- tracing: Resolves an issue where `DD_TRACE_<INTEGRATION>_ENABLED=False` could not be used to disable the following integrations when `ddtrace-run` was used: flask, django, bottle, falcon, and pyramid.

- asgi: Ensures `error.message` and `error.stack` tags are set when an exception is raised in a route.

- appsec: Fixes an encoding error when we are unable to cleanup the AppSec request context associated with a span.

- ASM: Fixes encoding error when using AppSec and a trace is partial flushed.

- CI Visibility: This fix resolves an issue where the tracer was doing extra requests if the `DD_CIVISIBILITY_ITR_ENABLED` env var was not set.

- CI Visibility: This fix resolves an issue where the API call would fail because it is reporting a null service name

- bootstrap: fixed an issue with the behavior of `ddtrace.auto` that could have caused incompatibilities with frameworks such as `gevent` when used as a programmatic alternative to the `ddtrace-run` command.

- django: Fixed a bug that prevented a Django application from starting with celery and gevent workers if `DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE` was not explicitly set.

- tracing: Fixes a cryptic encoding exception message when a span tag is not a string.

- ASM: fix extract_body for Django such that users of Django Rest Framework can still use custom parsers.

- flask: Remove patching for Flask hooks `app.before_first_request` and `bp.before_app_first_request` if Flask version \>= 2.3.0.

- gevent: Fix a bug that caused traceback objects to fail to pickle when using gevent.

- OpenAI: Resolved an issue where OpenAI API keys set in individual requests rather than as an environment variable caused an error in the integration.

- profiler: Fixed a bug that caused segmentation faults in applications that use protobuf as a runtime dependency.

- redis: Resolves an issue where the aioredis/aredis/yaaredis integrations cross-imported a helper method from the redis integration, which triggered redis patching before the redis integration was fully loaded.

- wsgi: Resolves an issue where accessing the `__len__` attribute on traced wsgi middlewares raised a TypeError

- django: Adds catch to guard against a ValueError, AttributeError, or NotImplementedError from being thrown when evaluating a django cache result for `db.row_count` tag.

- lib-injection: Ensure local package is installed. Previously the package
  could still be pulled from the internet causing application slowdowns.

- kafka: Fixes `TypeError` raised when arbitrary keyword arguments are passed to `confluent_kafka.Consumer`

- profiler: Fix support for latest versions of protobuf.

- psycopg: Resolves an issue where an AttributeError is raised when `psycopg.AsyncConnection` is traced.

- sanic: Resolves `sanic_routing.exceptions.InvalidUsage` error raised when gevent is installed or `DD_UNLOAD_MODULES_FROM_SITECUSTOMIZE` is set to True.

- elasticsearch: This fix resolves an issue where the tracer would throw an error when patching unsupported versions of elasticsearch (\> 8.0). Patching is now skipped if an unsupported version is detected.

### Other Changes

- span: Increases the traceback limit in `error.stack` tags from 20 to 30
- aws_lambda: Logs warnings and exceptions on cold start only.

---

## v1.13.0

### New Features

- psycopg: This release adds support for the new psycopg3 package. This new integration has all the same tracing functionality as the previous psycopg2-binary package, with added support for new methods including async connection and async cursor classes. The release also adds support for using Django\>=4.2 with psycopg3 integrated tracing.

### Bug Fixes

- algoliasearch: This fix resolves an issue where non-text search query arguments caused Type Errors when being added as tags.

- ASM: fix calling <span class="title-ref">set_user</span> without a created span raising a <span class="title-ref">ValueError</span>.

- django: Adds fix for bug where Django cache return object throws an error if it does not implement `__bool__()`.

- kafka: Previously instantiating a subclass of kafka's Producer/Consumer classes would result in attribute errors due to patching the Producer/Consumer classes with an ObjectProxy. This fix resolves this issue by making the traced classes directly inherit from kafka's base Producer/Consumer classes.

- profiling: Fixed a regression in the memory collector that caused it to fail to cleanly re-initialize after a fork, causing error messages to be logged.

- logging: Ensure that the logging module can report thread information, such as thread names, correctly when a framework like gevent is used that requires modules cleanup.

- ASM: This fix resolves an issue where path parameters for the Flask framework were handled at response time instead of at request time for suspicious request blocking. This close a known issue opened in 1.10.0.

- lib-injection: Switch installation to install from included wheels. Prior,
  the wheels were merged together which caused conflicts between versions of dependencies based on Python version.

- tracer: Handle exceptions besides `ImportError` when integrations are loaded.

### Other Changes

- ASM: Add information about Application Security config values on <span class="title-ref">ddtrace-run --info</span>.
- otel: Fixes code formatting in api docs

---

## v1.12.0

### New Features

- tracing: Adds support for 128 bit trace ids for b3 and w3c distributing tracing headers.
- pytest: Adds the `DD_CIVISIBILITY_AGENTLESS_ENABLED` environment variable to configure the `CIVisibility` service to use an agent-less test reporting `CIVisibilityWriter`. Note that the `CIVisibility` service will use regular agent reporting by default.
- sci: Extracts and sends git metadata from environment variables `DD_GIT_REPOSITORY_URL`, `DD_GIT_COMMIT_SHA`, or from the python package specified in the `DD_MAIN_PACKAGE`. This feature can be disabled by setting `DD_TRACE_GIT_METADATA_ENABLED=False`.
- otel: Adds support for the [OpenTelemetry Tracing API](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/reference/specification/trace/api/). Please refer to the `docs <ddtrace.opentelemetry>` for more details.

### Bug Fixes

- tracing: Ensure datadog headers propagate 128 bit trace ids when `DD_TRACE_128_BIT_TRACEID_GENERATION_ENABLED=False`
- aws_lambda: Fix AttributeError raised when `ddtrace.patch_all()`, or `ddtrace.patch(aws_lambda=True)`, is set on user handler.
- aws_lambda: Fix AttributeError raised when extracting context from arguments.
- aws_lambda: Fix AttributeError raised when callable handlers are traced.
- dynamic instrumentation: Fixed an issue with expressions in metric probes that prevented them from being evaluated.
- Prevent exceptions when autoreloading modules that directly or indirectly import ddtrace with the iPython autoreload extension.
- profiling: Corrects accounting of wall and CPU time for gevent tasks within the main Python thread.
- profiling: Fixed an issue with the memory collector where a segmentation fault could occur during shutdown.
- lib-injection: The ddtrace package is now provided via the Docker image rather than relying on a run-time `pip install`. This solves issues like containers blocking network requests, installation overhead during application startup, permissions issues with the install.

---

## v1.11.0

### Deprecation Notes

- ASM: Several deprecated ASM constants that were added to the public API will be removed. This should not affect existing code as they were meant for private use only.

### New Features

- tracing: Adds support for 128 bit trace ids. To generate and propagate 128 bit trace ids using Datadog distributed tracing headers set the following configuration: `DD_TRACE_128_BIT_TRACEID_GENERATION_ENABLED=True`. Support for B3 and W3C distributed tracing headers will be added in a future change.
- aiohttp: Add missing component meta tag to aiohttp server spans.
- redis: Adds tracing support for <span class="title-ref">redis.cluster.RedisCluster</span>.
- celery: Adds automatic tracing of the `celery.beat` scheduling service to the `celery` integration.
- kafka: Adds instrumentation support for `confluent-kafka>=1.7`. See the `confluent-kafka<https://ddtrace.readthedocs.io/en/stable/integrations.html#kafka>` documentation for more information.
- dynamic instrumentation: introduced support for dynamic span probes.
- Adds source code integration with setuptools build metadata. This enables traces and profiles to be automatically tagged with git metadata to track deployments in Datadog.

### Bug Fixes

- tracing: This fix resolves an issue where making a sampling decision before the `env` span tag had been set caused sample rate data from the Datadog Agent to be ignored.
- ASM: make `track_custom_event()` also set `appsec.events.<custom_event>.track` which was missing.
- django: Fixes an issue where `http.route` was only set if `use_handler_resource_format` and `use_legacy_resource_format` were set to `False`.
- tracing: This fix resolves an issue where a very long string as a span attribute would cause that span not to be delivered. It replaces string span attributes larger than DD_TRACE_WRITER_BUFFER_SIZE_BYTES (which as of this version defaults to 8388608) with a small string containing debug information and not containing any of the original attribute string.
- ASM: Resolves installation issues with compiling native code on Windows and unknown platforms.
- aws_lambda: Fixes a `RecursionError` which is raised when aws lambda signal handlers are wrapped infinitely. This caused lambdas to crash on startup.
- botocore: Fix TypeError raised by injecting trace context into Kinesis messages.
- dynamic instrumentation: Fix a bug where the dynamic instrumentation would stop injecting function probes after the first failed one.
- dynamic instrumentation: This change fixes a bug whereby probes that have been disabled/removed from the front-end would not be removed by the client library.
- futures: Resolves an issue that prevents tasks from being submitted to a thread pool executor when gevent is used (e.g. as a worker class for gunicorn or celery).
- propagation: This fix resolves an issue where previously W3C tracestate propagation could not handle whitespace. With this fix whitespace is now removed for incoming and outgoing requests.
- httplib: Fixes an issue with patching of http client upon import
- Ensure DD_REMOTE_CONFIGURATION_ENABLED environment variable disables remote config if set to False

### Other Changes

- aws_lambda: Updates how <span class="title-ref">DD_APM_FLUSH_DEADLINE_MILLISECONDS</span> is used. Previously, we would set the deadline as the environment variable value, if set. Now, when the remaining time in an AWS Lambda invocation is less than <span class="title-ref">DD_APM_FLUSH_DEADLINE_MILLISECONDS</span>, the tracer will attempt to submit the current active spans and all finished spans. the value in the environment variable is used to subtract from the deadline. The default is still 100ms.

---

## v1.9.1

### Deprecation Notes

- gevent: `DD_GEVENT_PATCH_ALL` is deprecated and will be removed in the next major version. Gevent compatibility is now automatic and does not require extra configuration when running with `ddtrace-run`. If not using `ddtrace-run`, please import `ddtrace.auto` before calling `gevent.monkey.patch_all()`.

### Bug Fixes

- aws_lambda: Resolves an exception not being handled, which occurs when no root span is found before a lambda times out.
- gevent: This fix resolves an incompatibility between ddtrace and gevent that caused threads to hang in certain configurations, for example the profiler running in a gunicorn application's gevent worker process.

### Other Changes

- ASM: The list of headers for retrieving the IP when Application Security Management is enabled or the
  <span class="title-ref">DD_TRACE_CLIENT_IP_ENABLED</span> environment variable is set has been updated. "Via" has been removed as it rarely contains IP data and some common vendor headers have been added. You can also set the environment variable <span class="title-ref">DD_TRACE_CLIENT_IP_HEADER</span> to always retrieve the IP from the header specified as the value.

---

## v1.10.0

### Prelude

Application Security Management (ASM) has added Django support for blocking malicious users using one click within Datadog.

<div class="note">

<div class="title">

Note

</div>

One click blocking for ASM is currently in beta.

</div>

### Deprecation Notes

- dbapi: `ddtrace.ext.mongo.ROWS` is deprecated. Use `ddtrace.ext.db.ROWCOUNT` instead.

### New Features

- starlette: Add http.route tag to `starlette.request` spans.
- fastapi: Add http.route tag to `fastapi.request` spans.
- ASM: Add support for one click blocking of user ids with the Django framework using Remote Configuration Management.
- ASM: This introduces the "suspicious request blocking" feature for Django and Flask.

### Known Issues

- ASM: There is a known issue with the flask support for any rule blocking on `server.request.path_params`. The request will be correctly blocked but the client application will be receiving and processing the suspicious request. Possible workaround: use `server.request.uri.raw` instead, if you want the request to be blocked before entering the flask application.

### Bug Fixes

- dbapi: The dbapi integration no longer assumes that a cursor object will have a rowcount as not all database drivers implement rowcount.

- dbm: Support sql queries with the type `byte`.

- elasticsearch: Omit large `elasticsearch.body` tag values that are
  greater than 25000 characters to prevent traces from being too large to send.

- aws_lambda: This fix resolves an issue where existing signals were wrapped multiple times.

- profiling: Handles a race condition on process shutdown that would cause an error about a module not being started to occasionally appear in the logs.

- Fix for KeyError exceptions when when <span class="title-ref">ASM_FEATURES</span> (1-click activation) disabled all ASM products. This could cause 1-click activation to work incorrectly in some cases.
- ASM: Solve some corner cases where a Flask blocking request would fail because headers would be already sent.
- ASM: Solve the content-type not always being correct in blocking responses.
- ASM: Ensure the blocking responses have the following tags: <span class="title-ref">http.url</span>, <span class="title-ref">http.query_string</span>, <span class="title-ref">http.useragent</span>, <span class="title-ref">http.method</span>, <span class="title-ref">http.response.headers.content-type</span> and <span class="title-ref">http.response.headers.content-length</span>.
- ASM: fix memory leaks and memory corruption in the interface between ASM and the WAF library
- psycopg2: Fixes a bug with DSN parsing integration.

### Other Changes

- remote_config: Change the level of remote config startup logs to debug.

### Deprecation Notes

- grpc: Deprecates `ddtrace.contrib.grpc.constants.GRPC_PORT_KEY`. Use `ddtrace.ext.net.TARGET_PORT` instead.
- dbapi: `ddtrace.ext.sql.ROWS` is deprecated. Use `ddtrace.ext.db.ROWCOUNT` instead.
- cassandra: `ddtrace.ext.cassandra.ROW_COUNT` is deprecated. Use `ddtrace.ext.db.ROWCOUNT` instead.

### New Features

- Enable traces to be sent before an impending timeout for `datadog_lambda>=4.66.0`. Use `DD_APM_FLUSH_DEADLINE` to override the default flush deadline. The default is the AWS Lambda function configured timeout limit.

- debugger: Add dynamic log probes to that generate a log message and optionally capture local variables, return value and exceptions

- tracing: Add support for enabling collecting of HTTP request client IP addresses as the `http.client_ip` span tag. You can set the `DD_TRACE_CLIENT_IP_ENABLED` environment variable to `true` to enable. This feature is disabled by default.

- ASM: add support for one click blocking of IPs with the Django framework using Remote Configuration Management.

- ASM: add support for one click blocking of IPs with the Flask framework using
  Remote Configuration Management.

- ASM: also fetch loopback IPs if client IP fetching is enabled (either via ASM or DD_TRACE_CLIENT_IP_ENABLED).

- ASM: Enable ability to remotely activate and configure ASM features. To enable, check the Python Security page in your account. Note that this is a beta feature.

- profiling: Collects endpoint invocation counts.

- dynamic instrumentation: Python 3.11 is now supported.

- graphene: Adds support for Python 3.11.

- graphql: Adds support for Python 3.11.

- httpx: Add support for `httpx<0.14.0,>=0.9.0`.

- tracer/span: Add `Span.finish_with_ancestors` method to enable the abrupt
  finishing of a trace in cases where the trace or application must be immediately terminated.

### Known Issues

- remote config: There is a known issue with remote configuration management (RCM) when paired with gevent which can cause child processes to deadlock. If you are experiencing issues, we recommend disabling RCM with `DD_REMOTE_CONFIGURATION_ENABLED=false`. Note, this will disable one click activation for ASM.
- gunicorn: ddtrace-run does not work with gunicorn. To instrument a gunicorn application, follow the instructions [here](https://ddtrace.readthedocs.io/en/latest/integrations.html#gunicorn).

### Bug Fixes

- fastapi: Previously, custom fastapi middlewares configured after application startup were not traced. This fix ensures that all fastapi middlewares are captured in the <span class="title-ref">fastapi.request</span> span.

- tracing: Pads trace_id and span_ids in b3 headers to have a minimum length of 16.

- Fix full stacktrace being sent to the log on remote config connection errors.

- httpx: Only patch `httpx.AsyncClient` for `httpx>=0.11.0`.

- tracing: This fix resolves an issue with the encoding of traces when using the v0.5 API version with the Python optimization option flag `-O` or the `PYTHONOPTIMIZE` environment variable.

- pylons: This fix resolves an issue where `str.decode` could cause critical unicode decode errors when ASM is enabled. ASM is disabled by default.

- gevent: This fix resolves incompatibility under 3.8\>=Python\<=3.10 between `ddtrace-run` and applications that depend on `gevent`, for example `gunicorn` servers. It accomplishes this by keeping copies that have not been monkey patched by `gevent` of most modules used by `ddtrace`. This "module cloning" logic can be controlled by the environment variable `DD_UNLOAD_MODULES_FROM_SITECUSTOMIZE`. Valid values for this variable are "1", "0", and "auto". "1" tells `ddtrace` to run its module cloning logic unconditionally, "0" tells it never to run that logic, and "auto" tells it to run module cloning logic *only if* `gevent` is accessible from the application's runtime. The default value is "0".

- lib-injection: Use package versions published to PyPI to install the
  library. Formerly the published image was installing the package from source using the tagged commit SHA which resulted in slow and potentially failing installs.

- profiler: Handles potential `AttributeErrors` which would arise while collecting frames during stack unwinding in Python 3.11.

- remote config: ensure proper validation of responses from the agent.

---

## v1.8.0

### Upgrade Notes

- ASM: libddwaf upgraded to version 1.6.1 using a new library loading mechanism
- profiling: upgrades the profiler to support the `v2.4` backend API for profile uploads, using a new request format.

### Deprecation Notes

- `DD_REMOTECONFIG_POLL_SECONDS` environment variable is deprecated and will be removed in v2.0. Please use `DD_REMOTE_CONFIG_POLL_INTERVAL_SECONDS` instead.

### New Features

- CI Visibility: Add support for CI provider buddy.works

- The component tag has been added for all auto-instrumented spans. The value of the component tag is equal to the name of the integration that produced the span.

- tracing: Adds support for IPv6 agent hostnames for <span class="title-ref">DD_AGENT_HOST</span>.

- elasticsearch: Update `elasticsearch` integration to add support for `opensearch-py`. See [the elasticsearch documentation](https://ddtrace.readthedocs.io/en/stable/integrations.html#elasticsearch) for more information.

- ASM: one click activation enabled by default using Remote Configuration Management (RCM). Set `DD_REMOTE_CONFIGURATION_ENABLED=false` to disable this feature.

- ASM: New Application Security Events Tracking API, starting with the functions `track_user_login_success_event` and
  `track_user_login_failure_event` for tracking user logins (it will also internally call `set_user`) and `track_custom_event` for any custom events. You can find these functions in the `ddtrace.appsec.trace_utils` module. Calling these functions will create new tags under the `appsec.events` namespace (`appsec.events.user.login` for logins) allowing you to track these events with Datadog. In the future this will be used to provide protection against account takeover attacks (ATO). Public documentation will be online soon.

- celery: Enhances context tags containing dictionaries so that their contents are sent as individual tags (issue \#4771).

- tornado: Support custom error codes: <https://ddtrace.readthedocs.io/en/stable/advanced_usage.html#custom-error-codes>.

- CI Visibility: Support reliably linking tests to the pipeline that executed them.

### Known Issues

- profiling: There is currently a known performance regression issue with the profiler's code provenance feature. Note that this feature is disabled by default and will only be enabled if `DD_PROFILING_ENABLE_CODE_PROVENANCE` is set to true.

### Bug Fixes

- This fix improves a cryptic error message encountered during some `pip install ddtrace` runs under pip versions \<18.
- dynamic instrumentation: remove unnecessary log line from application start up
- This fix removes unintended url parts in the `http.url` tag.
- botocore: Before this change, the botocore integration stripped newlines from the JSON string encoded in the data blob of Amazon Kinesis records. This change includes a terminating newline if it is present in the decoded data.
- profiling: This fix resolves an issue in Python 3.11 where a PyFrameObject strong reference count was not properly decremented in the stack collector.
- telemetry: This fix resolves an issue when we try to fetch `platform.libc_ver()` on an unsupported system.
- Fix for ValueError when `@` is not present in network location but other part of the url.

### Other Changes

- profiler: CPU overhead reduction.

---

## v1.7.0

### Prelude

Initial library support has been added for Python 3.11.

<div class="note">

<div class="title">

Note

</div>

Continuous Profiler and Dynamic Instrumentation are not yet compatible and must be disabled in order to use the library with Python 3.11. Support for them will be added in a future release. To track the status, see the [Support Python 3.11](https://github.com/DataDog/dd-trace-py/issues/4149) issue on GitHub.

</div>

### Upgrade Notes

- The default propagation style configuration changes to `DD_TRACE_PROPAGATION_STYLE=tracecontext,datadog`. To only support Datadog propagation and retain the existing default behavior, set `DD_TRACE_PROPAGATION_STYLE=datadog`.
- tracer: support for Datadog Agent v5 has been dropped. Datadog Agent v5 is no longer supported since ddtrace==1.0.0. See <https://ddtrace.readthedocs.io/en/v1.0.0/versioning.html#release-support> for the version support.
- Python 3.11: Continuous Profiler and Dynamic Instrumentation must be disabled as they do not current support Python 3.11.
- The configured styles in `DD_TRACE_PROPAGATION_STYLE_EXTRACT` are now evaluated in order to specification. To keep the previous fixed evaluation order, set: `DD_TRACE_PROPAGATION_STYLE_EXTRACT=datadog,b3,b3 single header`.
- tracing: upgrades the default trace API version to `v0.5` for non-Windows systems. The `v0.5` trace API version generates smaller payloads, thus increasing the throughput to the Datadog agent especially with larger traces.
- tracing: configuring the `v0.5` trace API version on Windows machines will raise a `RuntimeError` due to known compatibility issues. Please see <https://github.com/DataDog/dd-trace-py/issues/4829> for more details.

### Deprecation Notes

- propagation: Configuration of propagation style with `DD_TRACE_PROPAGATION_STYLE=b3` is deprecated and will be removed in version 2.0.0. Please use the newly added `DD_TRACE_PROPAGATION_STYLE=b3multi` instead.
- aws: The boto, botocore and aiobotocore integrations no longer include all API parameters by default. To retain the deprecated behavior, set the environment variable `DD_AWS_TAG_ALL_PARAMS=1`. The deprecated behavior and environment variable will be removed in v2.0.0.

### New Features

- django: add configuration option to allow a resource format like <span class="title-ref">{method} {handler}.{url_name}</span> in projects with Django \<2.2.0
- django: Adds the `DD_DJANGO_INCLUDE_USER_NAME` option to toggle whether the integration sets the `django.user.name` tag.
- Added environment variable `DD_TRACE_PROPAGATION_STYLE` to configure both injection and extraction propagation styles. The configured styles can be overridden with environment variables `DD_TRACE_PROPAGATION_STYLE_INJECT` and `DD_TRACE_PROPAGATION_STYLE_EXTRACT`.
- tracing: This introduces `none` as a supported propagator for trace context extraction and injection. When `none` is the only propagator listed, the corresponding trace context operation is disabled. If there are other propagators in the inject or extract list, the none propagator has no effect. For example `DD_TRACE_PROPAGATION_STYLE=none`
- ASM: now http.client_ip and network.client.ip will only be collected if ASM is enabled.
- tracing: Adds support for W3C Trace Context propagation style for distributed tracing. The `traceparent` and `tracestate` HTTP headers are enabled by default for all incoming and outgoing HTTP request headers. The Datadog propagation style continue to be enabled by default.
- flask: Adds support for streamed responses. Note that two additional spans: `flask.application` and `flask.response` will be generated.
- profiling: Adds support for Python 3.11.
- tracer: added support for Python 3.11.

### Bug Fixes

- ASGI: response headers are correctly processed instead of ignored
- Fix issue with `attrs` and `contextlib2` version constraints for Python 2.7.
- CGroup file parsing was fixed to correctly parse container UUID for PCF containers.
- ASM: Do not raise exceptions when failing to parse XML request body.
- ASM: fix a body read problem on some corner case where don't passing the content length makes wsgi.input.read() blocks.
- aws: We are reducing the number of API parameters that the boto, botocore and aiobotocore integrations collect as span tags by default. This change limits span tags to a narrow set of parameters for specific AWS APIs using standard tag names. To opt out of the new default behavior and collect no API parameters, set the environment variable `DD_AWS_TAG_NO_PARAMS=1`. To retain the deprecated behavior and collect all API parameters, set the environment variable `DD_AWS_TAG_ALL_PARAMS=1`.
- tracing: make `ddtrace.context.Context` serializable which fixes distributed tracing across processes.
- django: avoid `SynchronousOnlyOperation` when failing to retrieve user information.
- Remove `forbiddenfruit` as dependency and rollback `wrapt` changes where `forbiddenfruit` was called. IAST: Patch builtins only when IAST is enabled.
- httpx: Fixes an incompatibility from `httpx==0.23.1` when the `URL.raw` property is not available.
- Fix error in patching functions. `forbiddenfruit` package has conflicts with some libraries such as `asynctest`. This conflict raises `AttributeError` exception. See issue \#4484.
- tracer: This fix resolves an issue where the rate limiter used for span and trace sampling rules did not reset the time since last call properly if the rate limiter already had max tokens. This fix resets the time since last call always, which leads to more accurate rate limiting.
- Ensure that worker threads that run on start-up are recreated at the right time after fork on Python \< 3.7.
- tracing: This fix resolves an issue where the `DD_SERVICE_MAPPING` mapped service names were not used when updating span metadata with the `DD_VERSION` set version string.
- wsgi: This fix resolves an issue where `BaseException` raised in a WSGI application caused spans to not be submitted.
- library injection: Pin the library version in the library injection image. Prior, the latest version of `ddtrace` would always be installed, regardless of the image version.
- Fix error in the agent response payload when the user disabled ASM in a dashboard using 1-click Remote Configuration.
- flask: add support for flask v2.3. Remove deprecated usages of `flask._app_ctx_stack` and `flask._request_ctx_stack`.
- The specification of `DD_TRACE_PROPAGATION_STYLE_EXTRACT` now respects the configured styles evaluation order. The evaluation order had previously been fixed and so the configured order was ignored.
- tracing: Ensures that encoding errors due to wrong span tag types will be logged. Previously, if non-text span tags were set, this resulted in v0.5 encoding errors to be output to `stderr` instead of to a logger.

### Other Changes

- Kubernetes library injection: run commands as non-root user.
- tracing: The value of `ddtrace.constants.PID` has been changed from `system.pid` to `process_id`. All spans will now use the metric tag of `process_id` instead.
- tracing: The exception logged for writing errors no longer includes a long, unhelpful stack trace. The message now also includes the number of traces dropped and the number of retries attempted.

## v1.6.0

### Prelude

Application Security Management (ASM) has added support for preventing attacks by blocking malicious IPs using one click within Datadog.

<div class="note">

<div class="title">

Note

</div>

One click activation for ASM is currently in beta.

</div>

Dynamic instrumentation allows instrumenting a running service dynamically to extract runtime information that could be useful for, e.g., debugging purposes, or to add extra metrics without having to make code changes and re-deploy the service. See <https://ddtrace.readthedocs.io/en/stable/configuration.html> for more details.

### Upgrade Notes

- Pin \[attrs\](<https://pypi.org/project/attrs/>) dependency to version `>=20` due to incompatibility with \[cattrs\](<https://pypi.org/project/cattrs/>) version `22.1.0`.
- Use `Span.set_tag_str()` instead of `Span.set_tag()` when the tag value is a text type as a performance optimizations in manual instrumentation.

### New Features

- ASM: add support for one click activation using Remote Configuration Management (RCM). Set `DD_REMOTE_CONFIGURATION_ENABLED=true` to enable this feature.
- ASM: ip address collection will be enabled if not explicitly disabled and appsec is enabled.
- tracing: HTTP query string tagged by default in http.url tag (sensitive query strings will be obfuscated).
- Django: set <span class="title-ref">usr.id</span> tag by default if <span class="title-ref">request.user</span> is authenticated.
- Introduced the public interface for the dynamic instrumentation service. See <https://ddtrace.readthedocs.io/en/stable/configuration.html> for more details.
- Add `Span.set_tag_str()` as an alternative to the overloaded functionality of `Span.set_tag()` when the value can be coerced to unicode text.
- Enable `telemetry <Instrumentation Telemetry>` collection when tracing is enabled.

### Bug Fixes

- ASM: only report actor.ip on attack.
- aioredis: added exception handling for <span class="title-ref">CancelledError</span> in the aioredis integration.
- CI Visibility: fixed AppVeyor integration not extracting the full commit message.
- Add iterable methods on TracedCursor. Previously these were not present and would cause iterable usage of cursors in DB API integrations to fail.
- Fix parsing of the `DD_TAGS` environment variable value to include support for values with colons (e.g. URLs). Also fixed the parsing of invalid tags that begin with a space (e.g. `DD_TAGS=" key:val"` will now produce a tag with label `key`, instead of `key`, and value `val`).
- opentracing: don't raise an exception when distributed tracing headers are not present when attempting to extract.
- sqlite3: fix error when using `connection.backup` method.
- Change dependency from `` backport_ipaddress` to ``ipaddress`. Only install`ipaddress\`\` for Python \< 3.7.
- gevent: disable gevent after fork hook which could result in a performance regression.
- profiling: restart automatically on all Python versions.
- profiling: fixes an issue with Gunicorn child processes not storing profiling events.
- wsgi: when using more than one nested wsgi traced middleware in the same app ensure wsgi spans have the correct parenting.

### Other Changes

- tracing: add http.route tag to root span for Flask framework.

---

## v1.5.0

### New Features

- graphene: add support for `graphene>=2`. [See the graphql documentation](https://ddtrace.readthedocs.io/en/stable/integrations.html#graphql) for more information.
- Add support for aiobotocore 1.x and 2.x.
- ASM: add user information to traces.
- ASM: collect http client_ip.
- ASM: configure the sensitive data obfuscator.
- ASM: Detect attacks on Pylons body.
- ASM: propagate user id.
- ASM: Support In-App WAF metrics report.
- Collect user agent in normalized span tag `http.useragent`.
- ASM: Detect attacks on XML body (for Django, Pylons and Flask).
- Adds support for Lambda profiling, which can be enabled by starting the profiler outside of the handler (on cold start).
- profiler: collect and export the class name for the wall time, CPU time and lock profiles, when available.
- add DD_PYMONGO_SERVICE configuration
- ASM: Redact sensitive query strings if sent in http.url.
- redis: track the connection client_name.
- rediscluster: add service name configuration with `DD_REDISCLUSTER_SERVICE`
- snowflake: add snowflake query id tag to `sql.query` span

### Bug Fixes

- aiohttp_jinja2: use `app_key` to look up templates.
- ASM: (flask) avoid json decode error while parsing request body.
- ASM: fix Python 2 error reading WAF rules.
- ASM: reset wsgi input after reading.
- tracing: fix handling of unicode `_dd.origin` tag for Python 2
- tracing: fix nested web frameworks re-extracting and activating HTTP context propagation headers.
- requests: fix split-by-domain service name when multiple `@` signs are present in the url
- profiling: internal use of RLock needs to ensure original threading locks are used rather than gevent threading lock. Because of an indirection in the initialization of the original RLock, we end up getting an underlying gevent lock. We work around this behavior with gevent by creating a patched RLock for use internally.
- profiler: Remove lock for data structure linking threads to spans to avoid deadlocks with the trade-off of correctness of spans linked to threads by stack profiler at a given point in time.
- profiling: fix a possible deadlock due to spans being activated unexpectedly.

---

## v1.4.0

### New Features

- graphql: add tracing for `graphql-core>2`. See [the graphql documentation](https://ddtrace.readthedocs.io/en/stable/integrations.html#graphql) for more information.
- ASM: Detect attacks on Django body.
- ASM: Detect attacks on Flask request cookies
- ASM: Detect attacks on Django request cookies

- The profiler now supports Windows.
- The profiler now supports code provenance reporting. This can be enabled by using the `enable_code_provenance=True` argument to the profiler or by setting the environment variable `DD_PROFILING_ENABLE_CODE_PROVENANCE` to `true`.

### Bug Fixes

- flask: add support for `flask>=2.2.0`
- Fixed the environment variable used for log file size bytes to be `DD_TRACE_LOG_FILE_SIZE_BYTES` as documented.
- jinja2: fix handling of template names which are not strings.
- Fixed support for pytest-bdd 6.
- Fixes cases where a pytest test parameter object string representation includes the `id()` of the object, causing the test fingerprint to constantly change across executions.
- wsgi: ignore GeneratorExit Exception in wsgi.response spans
- wsgi: ensures resource and http tags are always set on <span class="title-ref">wsgi.request</span> spans.

### Other Changes

- profiler: don't initialize the `AsyncioLockCollector` unless asyncio is
  available. This prevents noisy logs messages from being emitted in Python 2.

- docs: Added troubleshooting section for missing error details in the root span of a trace.

---

## v1.3.0

### New Features

- internal: Add support for Datadog trace tag propagation
- django: added `DD_DJANGO_INSTRUMENT_TEMPLATES=false` to allow tracing of Django template rendering.
- internal: Add sampling mechanism trace tag
- Add environment variables to write `ddtrace` logs to a file with `DD_TRACE_LOG_FILE`, `DD_TRACE_LOG_FILE_LEVEL`, and `DD_TRACE_FILE_SIZE_BYTES`
- Adds pytest-bdd integration to show more details in CI Visibility product.

### Bug Fixes

- starlette: Add back removed `aggregate_resources` feature.
- fastapi: Add back removed `aggregate_resources` feature.
- aiomysql: fix `AttributeError: __aenter__` when using cursors as context managers.
- asgi, starlette, fastapi: Exclude background tasks duration from web request spans.

- starlette: Add back removed `ddtrace.contrib.starlette.get_resource` and `ddtrace.contrib.starlette.span_modifier`.
- fastapi: Add back removed `ddtrace.contrib.fastapi.span_modifier`.
- internal: fix exception raised for invalid values of `DD_TRACE_X_DATADOG_TAGS_MAX_LENGTH`.
- flask_caching: fix redis tagging after the v2.0 release.
- redis: create default Pin on asyncio client. Not having a Pin was resulting in no traces being produced for the async redis client.

### Other Changes

- perf: don't encode default parent_id value.
- profiling: add support for protobuf \>=4.0.

---

## v1.2.0

### Upgrade Notes

- The profiler `asyncio_loop_policy` attribute has been renamed to `asyncio_loop_policy_class` to accept a user-defined class. This guarantees the same asyncio loop policy class can be used process children.

### New Features

- Add tracing support for `aiomysql>=0.1.0`.

- Add support for `grpc.aio`.

- botocore: allow defining error status codes for specific API operations.

  See our `botocore` document for more information on how to enable this feature.

- ciapp: detect code owners of PyTest tests

- The memory profile collector can now entirely disabled with the `DD_PROFILING_MEMORY_ENABLED` environment variable.

- psycopg2: add option to enable tracing `psycopg2.connect` method.

  See our `psycopg2` documentation for more information.

- Add asyncio support of redis ≥ 4.2.0

### Bug Fixes

- Fixes deprecation warning for `asyncio.coroutine` decorator.

- internal: normalize header names in ASM

- profiling: implement `__aenter__` and `__aexit__` methods on `asyncio.Lock` wrapper.

- tracing: fix issue with `ddtrace-run` having the wrong priority order of tracer host/port/url env variable configuration.

- django,redis: fix unicode decode error when using unicode cache key on Python 2.7

- fastapi/starlette: when using sub-apps, formerly a call to `/sub-app/hello/{name}` would give a resource name of `/sub-app`. Now the full path `/sub-app/hello/{name}` is used for the resource name.

- sanic: Don't send non-500s error traces.

- pin protobuf to version `>=3,<4` due to incompatibility with version `4.21`.

- Fixes a performance issue with the profiler when used in an asyncio application.

- The profiler now copy all user-provided attributes on fork.

- pytest: Add note for disabling ddtrace plugin as workaround for side-effects

- Set required header to indicate top level span computation is done in the client to the Datadog agent. This fixes an issue where spans were erroneously being marked as top level when partial flushing or in certain asynchronous applications.

  The impact of this bug is the unintended computation of stats for non-top level spans.

### Other Changes

- The default number of events kept by the profiler has been reduced to decreased CPU and memory overhead.

---

## v1.1.4

### Bug Fixes

- pin protobuf to version `>=3,<4` due to incompatibility with version `4.21`.

---

### Bug Fixes

- profiling: implement `__aenter__` and `__aexit__` methods on `asyncio.Lock` wrapper.

---

## v1.1.1

### Bug Fixes

- internal: normalize header names in ASM

- Set required header to indicate top level span computation is done in the client to the Datadog agent. This fixes an issue where spans were erroneously being marked as top level when partial flushing or in certain asynchronous applications.

  The impact of this bug is the unintended computation of stats for non-top level spans.

## v1.1.0

### Prelude

The Datadog APM Python team is happy to announce the release of v1.0.0 of ddtrace. This release introduces a formal `versioning policy<versioning>` that simplifies the public `interface<versioning_interfaces>` and defines a `release version policy<versioning_release>` for backwards compatible and incompatible changes to the public interface.

The v1.0.0 release is an important milestone for the library as it has grown substantially in scope. The first commit to the library was made on June 20, 2016. Nearly sixty minor releases later, the library now includes over sixty integrations for libraries. And the library has expanded from Tracing to support the Continuous Profiler and CI Visibility.

<div class="important">

<div class="title">

Important

</div>

Before upgrading to v1.0.0, we recommend users install `ddtrace>=0.60.0,<1.0.0` and enable deprecation warnings. All removals to the library interface and environment variables were deprecated on 0.x branch. Consult `Upgrade 0.x<upgrade-0.x>` for recommendations on migrating from the 0.x release branch.

</div>

<div class="note">

<div class="title">

Note

</div>

The changes to environment variables apply only to the configuration of the ddtrace library and not the Datadog Agent.

</div>

#### Upgrading summary

##### Functionality changes

The default logging configuration functionality of `ddtrace-run` has changed to address conflicts with application logging configuration. See `note on the new default behavior<disable-basic-config-call-by-default>` and `note on deprecation<deprecate-basic-config-call>` for future removal.

##### Removed legacy environment variables

These environment variables have been removed. In all cases the same functionality is provided by other environment variables and replacements are provided as recommended actions for upgrading.

| Variable                            | Replacement                        | Note                                   |

##### Removed legacy tracing interfaces

These methods and module attributes have been removed. Where the same functionality is provided by a different public method or module attribute, a recommended action is provided for upgrading. In a few limited cases, because the interface was no longer used or had been moved to the internal interface, it was removed and so no action is provided for upgrading.

##### Removed legacy integration tracing

These tracing functions in integrations were no longer used for automatic instrumentation so have been removed. Any manual instrumentation code in an application will need to be replaced with `ddtrace.patch_all` or `ddtrace.patch` when upgrading.

##### Removed deprecated modules

These modules have been removed. Many were moved to the internal interface as they were not intended to be used as part of the public interface. In these cases, no action is provided for upgrading. In a few cases, other modules are provided as alternatives to maintain functionality. See the notes for more information.

### New Features

- Add `Span.get_tags` and `Span.get_metrics`.

- aiohttp: add client integration. This integration traces requests made using the aiohttp client and includes support for distributed tracing. See [the documentation](https://ddtrace.readthedocs.io/en/stable/integrations.html#aiohttp) for more information.

- aiohttp_jinja2: move into new integration. Formerly the aiohttp_jinja2 instrumentation was enabled using the aiohttp integration. Use `patch(aiohttp_jinja2=True)` instead of `patch(aiohttp=True)`. To support legacy behavior `patch(aiohttp=True)` will still enable aiohttp_jinja2.

- asyncpg: add integration supporting v0.18.0 and above. See `the docs<asyncpg>` for more information.

- fastapi: add support for tracing `fastapi.routing.serialize_response`.

  This will give an insight into how much time is spent calling `jsonable_encoder` within a given request. This does not provide visibility into how long it takes for `Response.render`/`json.dumps`.

- Add support to reuse HTTP connections when sending trace payloads to the agent. This feature is disabled by default. Set `DD_TRACE_WRITER_REUSE_CONNECTIONS=true` to enable this feature.

- MySQLdb: Added optional tracing for MySQLdb.connect, using the configuration option `here<mysqldb_config_trace_connect>`.

- The profiler now supports profiling `asyncio.Lock` objects.

- psycopg2: add option to enable tracing `psycopg2.connect` method.

  See our `psycopg2` documentation for more information.

- Add support for injecting and extracting B3 propagation headers.

  See `DD_TRACE_PROPAGATION_STYLE_EXTRACT <dd-trace-propagation-style-extract>` and `DD_TRACE_PROPAGATION_STYLE_INJECT <dd-trace-propagation-style-inject>` configuration documentation to enable.

### Deprecation Notes

- <div id="deprecate-basic-config-call">

  `DD_CALL_BASIC_CONFIG` is deprecated.

  </div>

### Bug Fixes

- Fixes deprecation warning for `asyncio.coroutine` decorator.

- botocore: fix incorrect context propagation message attribute types for SNS. This addresses [Datadog/serverless-plugin-datadog#232](https://github.com/DataDog/serverless-plugin-datadog/issues/232)

- aiohttp: fix issue causing `ddtrace.contrib.aiohttp_jinja2.patch` module to be imported instead of the `patch()` function.

- botocore: omit `SecretBinary` and `SecretString` from span metadata for calls to Secrets Manager.

- tracing/internal: fix encoding of propagated internal tags.

- Fix issue building `ddtrace` from source on macOS 12.

- Fix issue building `ddtrace` for the Pyston Python implementation by not building the `_memalloc` extension anymore when using Pyston.

- `tracer.get_log_correlation_context()`: use active context in addition to
  active span. Formerly just the span was used and this would break cross execution log correlation as a context object is used for the propagation.

- opentracer: update `set_tag` and `set_operation_name` to return a
  reference to the span to match the OpenTracing spec.

- The CPU profiler now reports the main thread CPU usage even when asyncio tasks are running.

- Fixes wrong numbers of memory allocation being reported in the memory profiler.

- pymongo: fix `write_command` being patched with the wrong method signature.

### Other Notes

- tracing/internal: disable Datadog internal tag propagation

---

## v1.0.3

### Bug Fixes

- Set required header to indicate top level span computation is done in the client to the Datadog agent. This fixes an issue where spans were erroneously being marked as top level when partial flushing or in certain asynchronous applications.

  The impact of this bug is the unintended computation of stats for non-top level spans.

---

## v1.0.2

### Bug Fixes

- Fixes deprecation warning for `asyncio.coroutine` decorator.

---

## v1.0.1

### Bug Fixes

- Fix issue building `ddtrace` for the Pyston Python implementation by not building the `_memalloc` extension anymore when using Pyston.

- `tracer.get_log_correlation_context()`: use active context in addition to
  active span. Formerly just the span was used and this would break cross execution log correlation as a context object is used for the propagation.

- The CPU profiler now reports the main thread CPU usage even when asyncio tasks are running.

## v1.0.0

### Prelude

The Datadog APM Python team is happy to announce the release of v1.0.0 of ddtrace. This release introduces a formal `versioning policy<versioning>` that simplifies the public `interface<versioning_interfaces>` and defines a `release version policy<versioning_release>` for backwards compatible and incompatible changes to the public interface.

The v1.0.0 release is an important milestone for the library as it has grown substantially in scope. The first commit to the library was made on June 20, 2016. Nearly sixty minor releases later, the library now includes over sixty integrations for libraries. And the library has expanded from Tracing to support the Continuous Profiler and CI Visibility.

<div class="important">

<div class="title">

Important

</div>

Before upgrading to v1.0.0, we recommend users install `ddtrace>=0.60.0,<1.0.0` and enable deprecation warnings. All removals to the library interface and environment variables were deprecated on 0.x branch. Consult `Upgrade 0.x<upgrade-0.x>` for recommendations on migrating from the 0.x release branch.

</div>

<div class="note">

<div class="title">

Note

</div>

The changes to environment variables apply only to the configuration of the ddtrace library and not the Datadog Agent.

</div>

#### Upgrading summary

##### Functionality changes

The default logging configuration functionality of `ddtrace-run` has changed to address conflicts with application logging configuration. See `note on the new default behavior<disable-basic-config-call-by-default>` and `note on deprecation<deprecate-basic-config-call>` for future removal.

##### Removed legacy environment variables

These environment variables have been removed. In all cases the same functionality is provided by other environment variables and replacements are provided as recommended actions for upgrading.

| Variable                            | Replacement                        | Note                                   |

##### Removed legacy tracing interfaces

These methods and module attributes have been removed. Where the same functionality is provided by a different public method or module attribute, a recommended action is provided for upgrading. In a few limited cases, because the interface was no longer used or had been moved to the internal interface, it was removed and so no action is provided for upgrading.

##### Removed legacy integration tracing

These tracing functions in integrations were no longer used for automatic instrumentation so have been removed. Any manual instrumentation code in an application will need to be replaced with `ddtrace.patch_all` or `ddtrace.patch` when upgrading.

##### Removed deprecated modules

These modules have been removed. Many were moved to the internal interface as they were not intended to be used as part of the public interface. In these cases, no action is provided for upgrading. In a few cases, other modules are provided as alternatives to maintain functionality. See the notes for more information.

### New Features

- Add `Span.get_tags` and `Span.get_metrics`.
- aiohttp: add client integration. This integration traces requests made using the aiohttp client and includes support for distributed tracing. See [the documentation](https://ddtrace.readthedocs.io/en/stable/integrations.html#aiohttp) for more information.
- aiohttp_jinja2: move into new integration. Formerly the aiohttp_jinja2 instrumentation was enabled using the aiohttp integration. Use `patch(aiohttp_jinja2=True)` instead of `patch(aiohttp=True)`. To support legacy behavior `patch(aiohttp=True)` will still enable aiohttp_jinja2.
- asyncpg: add integration supporting v0.18.0 and above. See `the docs<asyncpg>` for more information.

### New Features

- Add automatic unix domain socket detection for traces. The expected path for the socket is `/var/run/datadog/apm.socket` which if exists, will be used instead of the previous http default, `http://localhost:8126/`. To be used in conjunction with `apm_config.receiver_socket` in your `datadog.yaml` file, or the `DD_APM_RECEIVER_SOCKET` environment variable set on the Datadog agent.

### Deprecation Notes

- The DD_TRACER_PARTIAL_FLUSH_ENABLED and DD_TRACER_PARTIAL_FLUSH_MIN_SPANS environment variables have been deprecated and will be removed in version 1.0 of the library.

### New Features

- The `ddtrace.Tracer.get_log_correlation_context` method has been added to replace `ddtrace.helpers.get_correlation_ids`. It now returns a dictionary which includes the current span's trace and span ids, as well as the configured service, version, and environment names.
- The gevent tasks are now tracked by the threading lock events

### Bug Fixes

- Fixes an issue where a manually set `django.request` span resource would get overwritten by the integration.
- Pin `setup_requires` dependency `setuptools_scm[toml]>=4,<6.1` to avoid breaking changes.
- The profiler now updates the trace resource when capturing span information with the stack and lock collectors. That means that if the trace resource changes after the profiling events are created, the profiler samples will also be updated. This avoids having trace resource being empty when profiling, e.g., WSGI middleware.

  - \`DD_GIT_COMMIT_COMMITTER_NAME\`: Commit committer name
  - \`DD_GIT_COMMIT_COMMITTER_EMAIL\`: Commit committer email
  - \`DD_GIT_COMMIT_COMMITTER_DATE\`: The commit committer date (ISO 8601)

### Bug Fixes

- ASGI: handle decoding errors when extracting headers for trace propagation.

- Corrected some typing annotations for PEP 484 compliance

- Django: add support for version 3.1+ ASGI applications. A different codepath is taken for requests starting in Django 3.1 which led to the top level span not being generated for requests. The fix introduces automatic installation of the ASGI middleware to trace Django requests.

- dogpile.cache: handle both kwargs and args in the wrapper functions (using
  only kwargs would result in an IndexError.

- Fixes an issue with the Django integration where if the `urlconf` changes at any point during the handling of the request then the resource name will only be `<METHOD> 404`. This fix moves resource name resolution to the end of the request.

- Fixes error with tagging non-string Flask view args.

- `werkzeug.exceptions.NotFound` 404 errors are no longer raised and logged as a server error in the Flask integration.

- Fixes type hinting for `**patch_modules` parameter for `patch`/`patch_all` functions.

- Fixes an issue when using the pytest plugin with doctest which raises an `AttributeError` on `DoctestItem`.

- Fixes a bug in the pytest plugin where xfail test cases in a test file with a module-wide skip raises attribute errors and are marked as xfail rather than skipped.

- Fixed the handling of sanic endpoint paths with non-string arguments.

- opentracer: don't override default tracing config for the <span class="title-ref">ENABLED</span>,
  <span class="title-ref">AGENT_HOSTNAME</span>, <span class="title-ref">AGENT_HTTPS</span> or <span class="title-ref">AGENT_PORT</span> settings.

## v0.51.0

### Upgrade Notes

- The legacy Django configuration method (deprecated in 0.34) has been removed.
- botocore: Update trace propagation format for directly invoked Lambda functions. This breaks compatibility with Lambda functions instrumented with datadog-lambda-python \< v41 or datadog-lambda-js \< v3.57.0. Please upgrade datadog-lambda-\* in invoked lambda functions, or engage legacy compatibility mode in one of two ways:
  - ddtrace.config.botocore.invoke_with_legacy_context = True

Major changes to context management. See the upgrade section for the specifics. Note that only advanced users of the library should be affected by these changes. For the details please refer to the Context section of the docs: <https://ddtrace.readthedocs.io/en/v0.50.0/advanced_usage.html>

### Deprecation Notes

- The reuse of a tracer that has been shut down has been deprecated. A new tracer should be created for generating new traces.
- The deprecated dbapi2 configuration has been removed. The integration-specific configuration should be used instead. Look at the v0.48.0 release notes for migration instructions.

### Upgrade Notes

- `ddtrace.contrib.asyncio`

  - `AsyncioContextProvider` can now return and activate `None`, `Span` or `Context` objects.

- `ddtrace.contrib.gevent`

  - `GeventContextProvider` can now return and activate `None`, `Span` or `Context` objects.

- `ddtrace.contrib.tornado`

  - `TracerStackContext` can now return and activate `None`, `Span` or `Context` objects.

- `ddtrace.context.Context` no longer maintains the active/current span state.

  `get_current_root_span()` has been removed. Use `tracer.current_root_span()` instead. `get_current_span()` has been removed. Use `tracer.current_span()` instead. `add_span()` has been removed. To activate a span in an execution use `tracer.context_provider.activate()` instead. `close_span()` has been removed. To deactivate a span in an execution use `tracer.context_provider.activate()` instead.

- `ddtrace.provider.BaseContextProvider` `active()` now returns `None`, `Span` or `Context` objects. `activate()` now accepts `None`, `Span` or `Context` objects.

- `ddtrace.span.Span`

  - `Span.context` will now return a `Context`

- `ddtrace.tracer.Tracer` `tracer.get_call_context()` will now return a one-off `Context` reference. This is to maintain backwards compatibility with the API but the functionality differs slightly. `tracer.start_span()` passing a `span.context` for `child_of` no longer adds the strong `_parent` reference to the new span.

- Support for MySQL-python has been removed.

- Support for psycopg \< 2.7 has been removed.

### New Features

- Add `DD_CALL_BASIC_CONFIG={true,false}` environment variable to control whether `ddtrace` calls `logging.basicConfig`. By default when using `ddtrace-run` or running in debug mode `logging.basicConfig` is called to ensure there is always a root handler. This has compatibility issues for some logging configurations. `DD_CALL_BASIC_CONFIG=false` can be used to skip calling `logging.basicConfig`. The default value is `true` to maintain existing behavior.
- agent: support URL with a base path
- Automated context management should now work in all asynchronous frameworks that use `contextvars`.
- `tracer.start_span()` now accepts an `activate` argument (default `False`) to allow manual context management.
- `tracer.current_trace_context()` has been added to be used to access the trace context of the active trace.
- A warning has been added to alert when gevent monkey patching is done after ddtrace has been imported.
- Add support for Flask 2
- Added retry logic to the tracer to mitigate potential networking issues, like timeouts or dropped connections.
- Add new `DD_TRACE_AGENT_TIMEOUT_SECONDS` to override the default connection timeout used when sending data to the trace agent. The default is `2.0` seconds.
- The CI tagging for the pytest plugin now includes OS and Python Runtime metadata including system architecture, platform, version, and Python runtime name and version.
- Add new environment variables to configure the internal trace writer.

  `DD_TRACE_WRITER_MAX_BUFFER_SIZE`, `DD_TRACE_WRITER_INTERVAL_SECONDS`, `DD_TRACE_WRITER_MAX_PAYLOAD_SIZE_BYTES`

- The exception profiler now gathers and exports the traces and spans information.
- The pytest plugin now includes support for automatically tagging spans with parameters in parameterized tests.
- The Python heap profiler can now be enabled by setting the `DD_PROFILING_HEAP_ENABLED` environment variable to `1`.

### Bug Fixes

- The OpenTracing `tracer.start_span` method no longer activates spans.
- Datadog active spans will no longer take precedence over OpenTracing active spans.
- django: fix a bug where multiple database backends would not be instrumented.
- django: fix a bug when postgres query is composable sql object.
- A possible memory leak that occurs when tracing across a fork has been fixed. See <https://github.com/DataDog/dd-trace-py/pull/2497> for more information.
- Fix double patching of `pymongo` client topology.
- The shutdown task is re-registered when a tracer is reused after it has been shut down.
- Fixed the optional argument of `Span.finish` to `Optional[float]` instead of `Optional[int]`.
- Fixed the handling of the Django template name tag causing type errors.

- Fixes an issue when trying to manually start the runtime metrics worker:

      AttributeError: module 'ddtrace.internal.runtime' has no attribute 'runtime_metrics'

- sanic: update instrumentation to support version 21.

- Performance of the Celery integration has been improved.

- Fix runtime-id and system.pid tags not being set on distributed traces.

### Other Changes

- The pytest plugin now includes git metadata tags including author name and email as well as commit message from CI provider environments.
- The profiler won't be ignoring its own resource usage anymore and will report it in the profiles.
- The botocore integration excludes AWS endpoint call parameters that have a name ending with `Body` from the set of span tags.

---

## v0.49.4

### Bug Fixes

- Fixes an issue when trying to manually start the runtime metrics worker:

      AttributeError: module 'ddtrace.internal.runtime' has no attribute 'runtime_metrics'

- Fixes an issue with enabling the runtime worker introduced in v0.49.0 where no runtime metrics were sent to the agent.

### Bug Fixes

- django: fix a bug where multiple database backends would not be instrumented.
- django: fix a bug when postgres query is composable sql object.

---

## v0.49.2

### Bug Fixes

---

## v0.49.0

### Prelude

Several deprecations have been made to `Context` as we prepare to move active span management out of this class.

### Upgrade Notes

- Support for aiohttp previous to 2.0 has been removed.

- Support for deprecated <span class="title-ref">DD_PROFILING_API_URL</span> environment variable has been removed. Use <span class="title-ref">DD_SITE</span> instead.

- Support for deprecated <span class="title-ref">DD_PROFILING_API_KEY</span> environment variable has been removed. Use <span class="title-ref">DD_API_KEY</span> instead.

- Profiling support for agentless mode must now be explicitly enabled.

- The ddtrace pytest plugin can now label spans from test cases marked xfail with the tag "pytest.result"
  and the reason for being marked xfail under the tag "pytest.xfail.reason".

- Removed <span class="title-ref">ddtrace.ext.AppTypes</span> and its usages in the tracer library.

- requests: spans will no longer inherit the service name from the parent.

- The return value of `Span.pprint()` has been changed to a single line in the tracer debug logs rather than the previous custom multiline format.

- Spans are now processed per tracer instance. Formerly spans were stored per-Context which could be shared between tracer instances. Note that context management is not affected. Tracers will still share active spans.

- Spans from asynchronous executions (asyncio, gevent, tornado) will now be processed and flushed together. Formerly the spans were handled per-task.

- `tracer.write()` will no longer have filters applied to the spans passed to it.

- The function `ddtrace.utils.merge_dicts` has been removed.

### Deprecation Notes

- `Context.clone` is deprecated. It will not be required in 0.50.

- `Context.add_span` is deprecated and will be removed in 0.50.

- `Context.add_span` is deprecated and will be removed in 0.50.

- `Context.close_span` is deprecated and will be removed in 0.50.

- `Context.get_current_span` is deprecated and will be removed in 0.50 please use <span class="title-ref">Tracer.current_span</span> instead.

- `Context.get_current_root_span` is deprecated and will be removed in 0.50 please use `Tracer.current_root_span` instead.

- Deprecate the configuration of the analytics through the generic dbapi2 configuration. This should now be configured via integration configurations, for example:

      # Before
      export DD_TRACE_DBAPI2_ANALYTICS_ENABLED=1

      # After
      export DD_TRACE_SQLITE3_ANALYTICS_ENABLED=1

- <span class="title-ref">ddtrace.compat</span> has been deprecated and will be removed from the public API in ddtrace version 1.0.0.

- Deprecate <span class="title-ref">ddtrace.config.dbapi2</span> as default for <span class="title-ref">TracedCursor</span> and <span class="title-ref">TracedConnection</span> as well as <span class="title-ref">DD_DBAPI2_TRACE_FETCH_METHODS</span>. Use <span class="title-ref">IntegrationConfig</span> and <span class="title-ref">DD\_\<INTEGRATION\>\_TRACE_FETCH_METHODS</span> specific to each dbapi-compliant library. For example:

      # Before
      config.dbapi2.trace_fetch_methods = True

      # After
      config.psycopg2.trace_fetch_methods = True

- The use of `ddtrace.encoding` has been deprecated and will be removed in version 1.0.0.

- The <span class="title-ref">ddtrace.http</span> module has been deprecated and will be removed in version 1.0.0, with the <span class="title-ref">ddtrace.http.headers</span> module now merged into <span class="title-ref">ddtrace.trace_utils</span>.

- The `collect_metrics` argument of the `tracer.configure` method has been deprecated. Runtime metrics should be enabled only via the `DD_RUNTIME_METRICS_ENABLED` environment variable.

### New Features

- The futures integration is now enabled by default.
- requests: add global config support. This enables the requests service name to be configured with `ddtrace.config.requests['service']` or the `DD_REQUESTS_SERVICE` environment variable.

### Bug Fixes

- Fix broken builds for Python 2.7 on windows where `<stdint.h>` was not available. This change also ensures we build and publish `cp27-win` wheels.
- CGroup file parsing was fixed to correctly parse container ID with preceding characters.
- grpc: handle None values for span tags.
- grpc: handle no package in fully qualified method
- grpc: Add done callback in streaming response to avoid unfinished spans if a <span class="title-ref">StopIteration</span> is never raised, as is found in the Google Cloud libraries.
- grpc: handle IPv6 addresses and no port in target.
- Fix DD_LOGS_INJECTION incompatibility when using a `logging.StrFormatStyle` (`logging.Formatter(fmt, style="{")`) log formatter.
- Fixed a bug that prevented the right integration name to be used when trying to patch a module on import that is already loaded.
- Fix `urllib3` patching not properly activating the integration.
- gRPC client spans are now marked as measured by default.
- Fixes issue of unfinished spans when response is not a <span class="title-ref">grpc.Future</span> but has the same interface, as is the case with the base future class in <span class="title-ref">google-api-core</span>.
- In certain circumstances, the profiles generated in a uWSGI application could have been empty. This is now fixed and the profiler records correctly the generated events.
- The default agent timeout for profiling has been restored from 2 to 10 seconds to avoid too many profiles from being dropped.
- Fix issue with missing traces when using `pymemcache.client.hash.HashClient`.
- Added missing pymongo integration configuration, which allows overriding the service name for all the emitted spans.

### Other Changes

- Added environment variable <span class="title-ref">DD_BOTTLE_DISTRIBUTED_TRACING</span> to enable distributed tracing for bottle.
- The <span class="title-ref">attrs</span> library has been unvendored and is now required as a normal Python dependency with a minimum version requirement of 19.2.0.
- The <span class="title-ref">six</span> library has been removed from <span class="title-ref">vendor</span> and the system-wide version is being used. It requires version 1.12.0 or later.
- Documentation on how to use Gunicorn with the `gevent` worker class has been added.
- Added environment variable <span class="title-ref">DD_FALCON_DISTRIBUTED_TRACING</span> to enable distributed tracing for falcon.
- When extracting context information from HTTP headers, a new context is created when the trace ID is either 0 or not available within the headers.

---

## v0.48.0

### Upgrade Notes

- The deprecated <span class="title-ref">dogstatsd_host</span> and <span class="title-ref">dogstatsd_port</span> arguments to <span class="title-ref">tracer.configure()</span> have been removed.
- Support for gevent 1.0 has been removed and gevent \>= 1.1 is required.
- flask: deprecated configuration option <span class="title-ref">extra_error_codes</span> has been removed.
- The deprecated `pyddprofile` wrapper has been removed. Use `ddtrace-run` with `DD_PROFILING_ENABLED=1` set instead.
- A <span class="title-ref">ValueError</span> will now be raised on tracer initialization if the Agent URL specified to the initializer or with the environment variable <span class="title-ref">DD_TRACE_AGENT_URL</span> is malformed.
- **uWSGI** is no longer supported with `ddtrace-run` due to a limitation of how tracer initialization occurs. See the updated instructions for enabling tracing in the library `uWSGI documentation<uwsgi>`.

### New Features

- dogpile.cache: is now automatically instrumented by default.
- pylons: now supports all the standard http tagging including query string, custom error codes, and request/response headers.
- The ddtrace pytest plugin can now call `ddtrace.patch_all` via the `--ddtrace-patch-all` option.
- `Span` now accepts a `on_finish` argument used for specifying functions to call when a span finishes.
- Adds support for the Datadog Lambda Extension. The tracer will send traces to the extension by default if it is present.
- Add support for space-separated <span class="title-ref">DD_TAGS</span>.
- urllib3: add urllib3 integration

### Bug Fixes

- The `Records` parameter to `Firehose` endpoint calls is being excluded from the tags to avoid generating traces with a large payload.
- Tracer: fix configuring tracer with dogstatsd url.
- elasticsearch: patch versioned elasticsearch modules (elasticsearch1, ..., elasticsearch7).
- botocore: Do not assume that ResponseMeta exists in the results.
- django: handle erroneous middleware gracefully.
- The tracer now captures the task ID from the cgroups file for Fargate \>= 1.4.0 and reports it to the agent as the Datadog-Container-ID tag.
- Fix a bug when tracing a mako `DefTemplate` or any `Template` that does not have a `filename` property.
- flask: fix a bug when the query string would contain non-Unicode characters
- Fix a formatting issue on error exporting profiles.
- A workaround is provided for the problem with uWSGI worker processes failing to respawn. This can occur when using `ddtrace-run` for automatic instrumentation and configuration or manual instrumentation and configuration without the necessary uWSGI options. The problem is caused by how the tracer can end up starting threads in the master process before uWSGI forks to initialize the workers processes. To avoid this, we have provided updated instructions for enabling tracing in the library `uWSGI documentation<uwsgi>`.

### Other Changes

- The logic behind the header extraction for distributed tracing has been improved.
- The default connection timeout for the profiling agent has now been reduced from 10 to 2 seconds to match the tracer behavior.
- The tracemalloc memory profiler, which was disabled by default, has been removed.
- Query strings are stripped out from URLs by default when setting URL metadata on a span. This change affects all integrations that store HTTP metadata, like aiohttp, falcon, requests, urllib3.

---

- The profiler now automatically sets up uWSGI compatibility in auto mode or with <span class="title-ref">profile_children=True</span>. Make sure that you don't have custom code instrumenting the profiler in those cases.
- The `Tracer` class properties DEFAULT_HOSTNAME, DEFAULT_PORT, DEFAULT_DOGSTATSD_PORT, DEFAULT_DOGSTATSD_URL, DEFAULT_AGENT_URL have been removed.

### New Features

- cherrypy: introduce TraceMiddleware for the CherryPy web framework.

- wsgi: add tracing middleware.

### Bug Fixes

- Resolves an issue in Django tracing where, if <span class="title-ref">query_string</span> is not present in request.META, a KeyError is raised, causing the request to 500
- Deprecate the DD_LOGGING_RATE_LIMIT variable in favor of the standard DD_TRACE_LOGGING_RATE for configuring the logging rate limit.
- sampler: removed bug causing sample_rate of 0 to be reset to 1, and raise ValueError instead of logging.
- starlette: unpatch calls correctly.
- flask: fix memory leak of sampled out traces.
- Fix CPU time and wall time profiling not ignoring the profiler tasks with gevent.

### Other Changes

- The default maximum CPU time used for the stack profiler (CPU time, wall time and exceptions profiling) has been decreased from 2% to 1%.

---

## v0.46.0

### Upgrade Notes

- The profiler will only load tags from the DD_TAGS environment variable once at start.

### Deprecation Notes

- The <span class="title-ref">Profiler</span> object can now be passed tags with the <span class="title-ref">tags</span> keyword argument.

### Bug Fixes

- dbapi: avoid type error with potential non-compliance in db libraries when setting tag for row count.
- django: add legacy resource format of <span class="title-ref">{handler}</span>.
- grpc: fix wrapper for streaming response to support libraries that call an internal method directly.
- sanic: use path parameter names instead of parameter values for the resource.
- The profiler won't deadlock on fork when gevent monkey patch is enabled.
- requests: fix TracedSession when patches are not applied.

---

## v0.45.0

### Prelude

Build and deploy Python 3.9 wheels for releases

- Tracer.record() has similarly been removed as it is no longer useful with Context.get() removed.
- The deprecated compatibility module <span class="title-ref">ddtrace.profile</span> has been removed.
- The profiler now uses the tracer configuration is no configuration is provided.

### Deprecation Notes

- The <span class="title-ref">pyddprofile</span> wrapper is deprecated. Use <span class="title-ref">DD_PROFILING_ENABLED=true ddtrace-run</span> instead.
- The profiler does not catch uncaught exception anymore.

### New Features

- botocore: added <span class="title-ref">distributed_tracing</span> configuration setting which is enabled by default.

- The ddtrace-run command now supports the following arguments:
  -h, --help -d, --debug enable debug mode (disabled by default) -i, --info print library info useful for debugging -p, --profiling enable profiling (disabled by default) -v, --version show program's version number and exit

  It now also has friendlier error messages when used incorrectly.

- Add functionality to call gevent.monkey.patch_all() with ddtrace-run by setting the environment variable DD_GEVENT_PATCH_ALL=true. This ensures that gevent patching is done as early as possible in the application.

- botocore: inject distributed tracing data to <span class="title-ref">ClientContext</span> to trace lambda invocations.

- botocore: inject tracing data to <span class="title-ref">MessageAttributes</span>.

- The profiler now tracks the running gevent Greenlet and store it as part of the CPU and wall time profiling information.

- The profiler is now able to upload profiles to the Datadog Agent by using a Unix Domain Socket.

- It is now possible to pass a <span class="title-ref">url</span> parameter to the <span class="title-ref">Profiler</span> to specify the Datadog agent location.

- The new memory profiler for Python is now enabled by default. This improves the profiler memory consumption and performance impact. It can still be disabled by setting <span class="title-ref">DD_PROFILING_MEMALLOC=0</span> as an environment variable.

- The profiler now uses the tracer configuration is no configuration is provided.

- pytest integration. This enables the [pytest](https://pytest.org) runner to trace test executions.

### Deprecations

- The `decode()` method on our encoders located in `ddtrace.encoders` is scheduled to be removed in 0.40.

### Integrations

#### Django

- Add headers tracing configuration. This will enable headers on requests to be attached as tags on request spans. This can be done by using the `ddtrace.config` API like so: `config.django.http.trace_headers(["my-header-i-want-to-trace"])`. Thanks to @JoseKilo for contributing this feature!
- Fix for a bug where we didn't handle all cases for a template name. Thanks @sibsibsib!

#### Elasticsearch

- Fix for a bug that causes the tracer to crash if params is `None`.

#### grpc

- Fix handling `None` RpcMethodHandlers

### Tracer

- core: deprecate encoder decode()

### Profiling

- Now included by default with the tracing package
- Support for the `DD_ENV` and `DD_VERSION` environment variable configuration.
- A bunch of gevent fixes. See below for the details.

### OpenTracing

- Support for tracer interleaving between the Datadog tracer (used in integrations) and the OpenTracing tracer provided in the library.

## 0.36.0 (01/04/2020)
# Upgrading to 0.36.0

This release includes support for setting global application tags which will help Datadog better correlate your Python application traces and logs with other services in your infrastructure.

By providing the following settings, `ddtrace` will tag your application's traces and logs appropriately:

- `DD_ENV` environment variable or `ddtrace.config.env`: the environment in which your application is running. eg: `prod`, `staging`.
- `DD_VERSION` environment variable or `ddtrace.config.version`: the version of your application. eg: `1.2.3`, `6c44da20`, `2020.02.13`
- `DD_SERVICE` environment variable or `ddtrace.config.service`: the service which your application represents.

In you are using our logging integration manually, please update your formatter to also include the `dd.env`, `dd.service` and `dd.version` attributes as well. See our docs on [Logs Injection](http://pypi.datadoghq.com/trace/docs/advanced_usage.html?highlight=injection#logs-injection) for more details.

## Profiling
If you are using the profiler, please note that `ddtrace.profile` has been renamed to `ddtrace.profiling`.

## 0.30.2 (21/10/2019)
## Changes

This bug fix release introduces a fix for the agent writer that would cause traces to not be successfully flushed when the process forks.

Whenever we detect that we are in a new process (`os.getpid()` changes) we create a new queue to push finished traces into for flushing. In the previous version of the tracer (`v0.29.x`) we would also recreate the background thread that would read from this queue to ensure that we 1) had one background worker per-process and 2) had an updated reference to the new queue we created.

In the process of simplifying the code for the agent writer in `v0.30.0` we kept the code to recreate the queue, but didn't fully replicate the behavior for recreating the background thread. This meant that whenever the process was forked the background thread would maintain a reference to the old queue object and therefore be unable to pull traces from the queue we were pushing them into causing traces to get stuck in memory in the new queue (since no one was pulling from it).

With these changes we are recreating the entire background worker whenever the process is forked. This will cause us to once again create a new queue and new background thread for flushing finished traces.

## 0.21.1 (21/02/2019)
## Upgrading to 0.21.1

This is a bug fix release that requires no changes to your code.

Included in this release is a fix for some database cursors where we would force `Cursor.execute` and `Cursor.executemany` to return a cursor instead of the originally intended output. This caused an issue specifically with MySQL libraries which tried to return the row count and we were returning a cursor instead.

## Changes
### Bugs
* [core] Patch logging earlier for ddtrace-run (#832)
* [dbapi2] Fix dbapi2 execute/executemany return value (#830 )
* [core] Use case-insensitive comparison of header names during extract (#826 -- thanks @defanator)

  - flask
  - molten
  - pylons
  - pyramid
  - requests
  - tornado

---

## 0.20.3 (04/02/2019)
## Upgrading to 0.20.3

This is a bug fix release that requires no changes.

This release includes a fix for context propagation with `futures`. Under the right conditions we could incorrectly share a trace context between multiple `futures` threads which result in multiple traces being joined together in one.

## Changes
### Bug fixes
* [core] Allow futures to skip creating new context if one doesn't exist (#806)

Read the [full changeset](https://github.com/DataDog/dd-trace-py/compare/v0.20.2...v0.20.3) and the [release milestone](https://github.com/DataDog/dd-trace-py/milestone/37?closed=1).
---

## 0.20.2 (29/01/2019)
## Upgrading to 0.20.2

No changes are needed to upgrade to `0.20.2`.

This big fix release includes changes to ensure we properly read the HTTP response body from the trace agent before we close the HTTP connection.

## Changes
### Bug fixes

---

## 0.20.0 (09/01/2019)
# Upgrading to 0.20.0

We have added support for logs injection to the tracer. If you are already using `ddtrace-run`, the integration can be enabled with setting the environment variable `DD_LOGS_INJECTION=true`. The default behavior once logs injection is enabled is to have trace information inserted into all log entries. If you prefer more customization, you can manually instrument and configure a log formatter with the tracer information.

# Changes

## New Integrations

* [mako] Add Mako integration (#779 -- thanks @wklken)

## Enhancements

* [core] Tracer and logs integration (#777)

---

## 0.19.0 (28/12/2018)
## Upgrading to 0.19.0

With `0.19.0` we have decided to disable the tracing of `dbapi2` `fetchone()`/`fetchmany()`/`fetchall()` methods by default.

This change effects all integrations which rely on the `dbapi2` API, including `psycopg2`, `mysql`, `mysqldb`, `pymysql`, and `sqlite3`.

We have introduced this change to reduce the noise added to traces from having these methods (mostly `fetchone()`) traced by default.

With `fetchone()` enabled the traces received can get very large for large result sets, the resulting traces either become difficult to read or become too large causing issues when flushing to the trace agent, potentially causing traces to be dropped.

To re-enable the tracing of these methods you can either configure via the environment variable `DD_DBAPI2_TRACE_FETCH_METHODS=true` or manually via:

```python
from ddtrace import config
config.dbapi2.trace_fetch_methods = True
```

## Changes
### Bugs
[dbapi2] disable fetchone/fetchmany/fetchall tracing by default (#780)
[opentracing] Fixing context provider imports for scope manager (#771 -- thanks @Maximilien-R)

### Enhancements
[tests] test python setup.py sdist and twine check on build (#782)
[core] Add API to configure Trace Search (#781)
[core] Enable priority sampling by default (#774)

## 0.14.0 (11/09/2018)
**OpenTracing**

In this release we are happy to introduce the beta for the long-awaited OpenTracing compatible API layer for `ddtrace`!

Support for `opentracing>=2.0.0` is provided in this release. Namely, the following are supported:

- `start_span`/`start_active_span`
- `inject` and `extract` functionality
- `baggage`, through `set_baggage_item` and `get_baggage_item`
- compatible tags from the [OpenTracing specification](https://github.com/opentracing/specification/blob/b193756f1fe646b79ef4f901bed92c0e72845440/semantic_conventions.md#standard-span-tags-and-log-fields)
- scope manager support
- seamless integration with the Datadog tracer when using `ddtrace-run`

For setup information and usage see [our docs for the Datadog OpenTracing tracer](http://pypi.datadoghq.com/trace/docs/installation_quickstart.html#opentracing).


**CI Improvements**

Also included in this release are some optimizations to our CI which should get things running a bit quicker.

Thanks @labbati!

---

## 0.13.0 (23/08/2018)
**New integrations**
- [`pymemcache`](https://github.com/pinterest/pymemcache) integration (#511)

**Celery integration**

Due to some limitations with our Celery integration, we changed our instrumentation to a [signals based approach](http://docs.celeryproject.org/en/latest/userguide/signals.html). We also started using import hooks to instrument Celery, so that enabling the instrumentation doesn't trigger a `celery` import.

- Signals implementation: #530
- Moving to import hooks: #534
- Resolved issues: #357, #493, #495, #495, #510, #370

**Breaking changes**
Using the signal based approach increase the stability of our instrumentation, but it limits what is currently traced. This is a list of changes that are considered breaking changes in the behavior and not in the API, so no changes are needed in your code unless you want a different behavior:
- By default all tasks will be traced if they use the Celery signals API, so tasks invoked with methods like `apply()`,  `apply_async()` and `delay()` will be traced but tasks invoked with `run()` will **not** be traced.
- `patch_task()` is deprecated; if it's used, all tasks will be instrumented

**Bug fixes**
- [core] check if bootstrap dir is in path before removal (#516 -- thanks @beezz!)
- [core] have hostname default to `DATADOG_TRACE_AGENT_HOSTNAME` environment variable if available (#509, #524 -- thanks @hfern!)
- [core] add WSGI-style http headers support to HTTP propagator (#456, #522)
- [core] Enable buffering on `getresponse` (#464, #527)
- [core] configure the root logger (#536)
- [aiopg] set the `app_type` during initialization (#492, #507)
- [boto] default to `None` if no region (#525, #526)
- [flask] avoid double instrumentation when `TraceMiddleware` is used (#538)
- [pymongo] fix multiple host kwargs (#535)
- [tornado] make settings object accessible during configuration (#499, #498 -- thanks @kave!)

**Improvements**
- [core/helpers] add a shortcut to retrieve Trace correlation identifiers (#488)

---

## 0.12.1 (14/06/2018)
**Bugfixes**

* [celery] add support for celery v1 tasks (old-style tasks) (#465, #423)

* [django/celery] add `shared_task` decorator wrapper to trace properly Celery tasks (#486, #451)
* [django/docs] notes about Debug Mode, and debugging (#476 -- thanks @ndkv!)
* [gevent] pass `sampling_priority` field when Distributed Tracing is enabled (#457)
* [mysqlb] add missing services info when they're flushed (#468, #428)

---

## 0.12.0 (03/05/2018)
**New integrations**
* [boto] Botocore and boto instrumentation is enabled by default using `patch_all()` (#319)
* [futures] provide context propagation for `concurrent` module (#429, [docs](http://pypi.datadoghq.com/trace/docs/#module-ddtrace.contrib.futures))
* [mysql] add `pymysql` support (#296, [docs](http://pypi.datadoghq.com/trace/docs/#mysql) -- thanks @wklken)

**Improvements**
* [core] introducing a low-level API to define configurations for each integration. This API is used only by the `requests` module and will be implemented in other integrations in newer releases (#445, #443, #450, #454, #441)
* [celery] split the service name in `celery-producer` and `celery-worker` for better stats (#432)
* [falcon] add distributed tracing (#437)
* [requests] provide a default service name for the request `Span` (#433)
* [requests] add `split_by_domain ` config to split service name by domain (#434)
* [tornado] better compatibility using `futures` instrumentation (#431)

**Bugfixes**
* [core] ensure `sitecustomize.py` is imported when `ddtrace-run` wrapper is used (#458)
* [flask] use `ddtrace` logger instead of Flask to avoid having a custom log filter (#447, #455)

**Breaking changes**
* [celery] the name of the service is now split in two different services: `celery-producer` and `celery-worker`. After the upgrade, you'll stop sending data to what was the default service name (`celery`). You should check the new services instead because you'll see a drop. Previously reported traces in the `celery` service, are still available if you move back the time selector.

---

## 0.11.0 (05/03/2018)
**Security fixes**

* [dbapi] remove `sql.query` tag from SQL spans, so that the content is properly obfuscated in the Agent. This security fix is required to prevent wrong data collection of reported SQL queries. This issue impacts only MySQL integrations and NOT `psycopg2` or `sqlalchemy` while using the PostgreSQL driver. (#421)

**New integrations**

* [django] add support for Django 2.0 (#415 -- thanks @sciyoshi!)
* [mysql] `MySQL-python` and `mysqlclient` packages are currently supported (#376 -- thanks @yoichi!)

## 0.10.0 (08/11/2017)
**Distributed Sampling (beta)**

New feature that propagates the sampling priority across services. This is useful to mark traces as "don’t keep the trace" or "must have" when distributed tracing is used. This new functionality requires at least the Datadog Agent 5.19+. Frameworks with out-of-the-box support are: Django, Flask, Tornado (#358, #325, #359, #364, #366, #365, #371, [docs](http://pypi.datadoghq.com/trace/docs/#priority-sampling))

**Improvements**
* [core] update the Context propagation API, that includes a new way to retrieve and set the current active `Span` context. (#339)
* [core] implement Propagators API to simplify Distributed Tracing. You can use `HTTPPropagator` class to inject and extract the tracing context in HTTP headers (#363, #374 [docs](http://pypi.datadoghq.com/trace/docs/#ddtrace.propagation.http.HTTPPropagator))
* [celery] use service name from `DATADOG_SERVICE_NAME` env var, if defined (#347 -- thanks @miketheman)
* [django] respect env Agent host and port if defined (#354 -- thanks @spesnova)

**Bugfixes**
* [pylons] handle exception with non standard 'code' attribute (#350)
* [pyramid] the application was not traced when the tween list was explicitly specified (#349)

---

## 0.9.2 (12/09/2017)
**New features**
* [django] disable database or cache instrumentation via settings so that each Django component instrumentation can be disabled (#314, [docs](http://localhost:8000/#module-ddtrace.contrib.django) -- thanks @mcanaves)
* [django] it's not required anymore to add the Django middleware because the Django app ensures that it is installed. You can safely remove `ddtrace.contrib.django.TraceMiddleware` for your middleware list after the upgrade. This is not mandatory but suggested (#314, #346)
* [cassandra] trace `execute_async()` operations (#333)

**Bugfixes**
* [mysql]  prevent the Pin from attaching empty tags (#327)
* [django] fixed the initialization order to prevent logs when the tracer is disabled (#334)
* [sqlite3] add tests to ensure that services are properly sent (#337)
* [pyramid] fixed Pyramid crash when 'include()' is used with relative import paths (#342)
* [pylons] re-raise the exception with the original traceback in case of errors. Before Pylons exceptions were correctly handled but hidden by the tracing middleware. (#317)
* [pyramid] disable autocommit in Pyramid patching, to avoid altering the `Configurator` behavior (#343)
* [flask] fix Flask instrumentation that didn't close Jinja spans if an error was thrown (#344)

**Integration coverage**
* officially support ElasticSearch 1.6+ (#341)

**Documentation**
* fixed usage examples for `patch_all()` and `patch()` (#321 -- thanks @gomlgs)
* added a section about updating the hostname and port (#335)

---

## 0.9.1 (01/08/2017)
**New features**
* [core] add a processing pipeline to the `AsyncWorker`, so that traces can be filtered easily. This change doesn't have any performance impact with existing installations, and is expected to work well with async frameworks / libraries (#303, [docs](http://pypi.datadoghq.com/trace/docs/#trace-filtering))
* [core] add language and library version metadata to keep track of them in the Datadog Agent. All values are sent via headers (#289)

**Bugfixes**
* [aiobotocore] update `async with` context manager so that it returns the wrapper instead of the wrapped object (#307)
* [boto, botocore] change the service metadata app for AWS with a more meaningful name (#315)

**Documentation**
* improving documentation so that it's more explicit how a framework should be auto-instrumented (#305, #308)
* add the list of auto-instrumented modules (#306)

## 0.9.0 (05/07/2017)
**New features**

* [core] add process ID in root spans metadata (#293)

**Improvements**

* [falcon] extended support for Falcon 1.2; improved error handling (#295)
* [gevent] create a new `Context` when a Greenlet is created so that the tracing context is automatically propagated with the right parenting (#287)
* [asyncio] providing helpers and `patch()` method to automatically propagate the tracing context between different asyncio tasks (#260 #297, [docs](http://pypi.datadoghq.com/trace/docs/#module-ddtrace.contrib.asyncio) -- thanks @thehesiod)
* [aiohttp] add experimental feature to continue a trace from request headers (#259, [docs](http://pypi.datadoghq.com/trace/docs/#module-ddtrace.contrib.aiohttp) -- thanks @thehesiod)
* [django] add `DEFAULT_DATABASE_PREFIX` setting to append a prefix to database service (#291, [docs](http://pypi.datadoghq.com/trace/docs/#module-ddtrace.contrib.django) -- thanks @jairhenrique)

**Bugfixes**

* [logging] use specific logger instead of the root one in `monkey.py` module (#281)
* [django] `ddtrace` exception middleware catches exceptions even if a custom middleware returns a `Response` object (#278)
* [pylons] handle correctly the http status code when it's wrongly formatted (#284)
* [django] request resource handles the case where the `View` is a partial function (#292)
* [flask] attach stack trace to Flask errors (#302)

**New integrations**

* [httplib] add patching for `httplib` and `http.lib`(#137 -- thanks @brettlangdon)
* [aio-libs] add `aiobotocore` support (#257, #298, [docs](http://pypi.datadoghq.com/trace/docs/#module-ddtrace.contrib.aiobotocore) -- thanks @thehesiod)

## 0.8.5 (30/05/2017)
**Bugfixes**

* [flask] add the http method to flask spans (#274)
* [sqlite3] changed the app_type to `db` (#276)
* [core] `span.set_traceback()`now sets the traceback even if there's no exception (#277)

---

## 0.8.4 (19/05/2017)
**Bugfixes**

* [flask] avoid using weak references when Flask is instrumented via Blinker. This resolves initialization issues when the `traced_app = TraceMiddleware(app, ...)` reference goes out of the scope or is garbage collected (#273)
---

## 0.8.3 (15/05/2017)
**Improvements**

* [transport] add presampler header (`X-Datadog-Trace-Count`) so that the receiving agent has more information when dealing with sampling (#254)
* [docs] updated our documentation (#264, #271)

**Bugfixes**
* [core] patch loader raises `PatchException` that is handled in the `patch_all()` when the patch failed. This distinguishes: errors during patch, when an integration is not available and simply when the module is not installed (#262)
* [mysql] distinguish `MySQL-Python` instrumentation so that only `mysql-connector` package is patched; this provides better feedback about what library is supported (#263, #266)
* [sqlalchemy] provide a `patch()` method that uses the PIN object; this is not a breaking change, but the preferred way to instrument SQLAlchemy is through `patch_all(sqlalchemy=True)` or `patch(sqlalchemy=True)` (#261)
* [pylons] catch `BaseException` since a `SystemExit` might've been raised; `500` errors are handled if a timeout occurs (#267, #270)
* [pyramid] catch `BaseException` since a `SystemExit` might've been raised; `500` errors are handled if a timeout occurs (#269)

---

## 0.8.0 (10/04/2017)
**New integrations**
* Add support for Tornado web `4.0+`. Currently this integration is ignored by autopatching, but can be enabled via `patch_all(tornado=True)` (#204, [docs][1] -- thanks @ross for reviewing and testing the implementation)

**Bugfixes**
* [docs] Minor updates to our documentation (#239, #237, #242, #244 -- thanks @liubin @pahaz)
* [boto] Boto2 and Botocore integrations have safety check to prevent double patching (#240)
* [boto] Use frames directly without calling `getouterframes()`. This is a major improvement that reduces the impact of our tracing calls for Boto2 (#243 -- thanks @wackywendell)
* [django] make `func_name` work with any callable and not only with functions (#195, #203 -- thanks @m0n5t3r)

**Breaking change**
* [elasticsearch] when importing `elasticsearch` before executing `patch_all()`, no traces are created. This patch changed where the `PIN` object is attached, so you should update your instrumentation as described below (#238)

**Migrate from 0.7.x to 0.8.0**

* [elasticsearch] the PIN object was previously attached to the `elasticsearch` module while now it uses `elasticsearch.Transport`. If you were using the `Pin` to override some tracing settings, you must update your code from:
```python
Pin.override(client, service='elasticsearch-traces')
```
to:
```python
Pin.override(client.transport, service='elasticsearch-traces')
```

**Internals update**
* the Python traces logs and returns error when there is a communication issue with the APM Agent (#173)
* the `wrap()` tracer decorator can be extended by Python integrations when the usual approach is not suitable for the given execution context (#221)

---

## 0.7.0 (29/03/2017)
**New integrations**
* Add support for `boto` (>=2.29.0) and `botocore` (>= 1.4.51) #209 . Currently these integrations are ignored by autopatching, but can be enabled via `patch_all(boto=True, botocore=True)`

**New features**
* Add the `ddtrace-run` command-line entrypoint to provide tracing without explicit additions to code. More information here http://pypi.datadoghq.com/trace/docs/#get-started #169

**Bugfixes**
* [dbapi] Ensure cursors play well with context managers #231
* [django] Provide a unique `datadog_django` app label to avoid clashes with existing app configs #235
* [pyramid] Ensure pyramid spans have method and route metadata consistent with other web frameworks #220 (thanks @johnpkennedy)
---

## 0.6.0 (09/03/2017)
**New integrations**
* Add support for asynchronous Python. This is a major improvement that adds support for `asyncio`, `aiohttp` and `gevent` (#161, docs: [asyncio][1] - [aiohttp][2] - [gevent][3])
* Add Celery integration (#135, #196, [docs][6])

**New features**
* Add explicit support for Python 3.5, and 3.6 (#215, see [supported versions][7])
* print the list of unfinished spans if the `debug_logging` is activated; useful in synchronous environments to detect unfinished/unreported traces (#210)

**Bugfixes**
* [mysql] `mysql` integration is patched when using `patch()` or `patch_all()` (#178)
* [django] set global tracer tags from Django `DATADOG_TRACE` setting (#159)
* [bottle] wrong `tracer` reference when `set_service_info` is invoked (#199)

**Breaking changes**
* Default port `7777` has been replaced with the new `8126` available from Datadog Agent 5.11.0 and above (#212)
* Removed the `ThreadLocalSpanBuffer`. It has been fully replaced by the `Context` propagation (#211)

**Migrate from 0.5.x to 0.6.0**

* Datadog Agent 5.11.0 or above is required.
* If you're using the `ThreadLocalSpanBuffer` manually, you need to use the [Context class][8] in your logic so that it is compliant with the `Context` propagation. Check the [Advanced usage][9] section.

**Advanced usage**
This is a list of new features that may be used for manual instrumentation when you're using a library or a framework that is not currently supported:
* Use `Context` propagation instead of a global buffer. This plays well with asynchronous programming where a context switching may happen while handling different logical execution flows (#172)
* `tracer.trace()` handles automatically the `Context` propagation and remains the preferable API
* Add `tracer.get_call_context()` to retrieve the current `Context` instance that is holding the entire trace for this logical execution ([docs][4])
* Add `start_span` as a way to manually create spans, while handling the Context propagation ([docs][5])

## 0.5.3 (23/12/2016)
**Bugfixes**
- [ElasticSearch] use ElasticSearch serializer so that the serialization works with dates, decimals and UUIDs #131
- [Django] use an integer value for `AGENT_PORT` because Django recast strings as unicode strings, which invalidate the input for `getaddrinfo()` in Python 2.7 #140
- [Tracer] downgrade high throughput log messages to debug so that it doesn't flood users logs #143

**Compatibility**
- don't check if `django.contrib.auth` is installed through the `django.apps` module. This improves the best-effort support for `Django < 1.7` #136

## 0.4.0 (26/11/2016)
0.4.0 is a "major" release of the `dd-trace-py`. Please test thoroughly on staging before rolling out to your production clusters.

  - The previous ways of patching still exist, but are deprecated and might be no-ops. They will be removed in a future version.
  - When you add `patch_all` remove your old instrumentation code.
  - Web frameworks still require middleware.
- experimental support for (much faster) msgpack serialization. disabled by default. will be enabled in a future release.

### Integrations
- add integration for the [Bottle](web framework) web framework. (see #86)

### Bug Fixes
- correctly trace django without auth middleware (see #116)
