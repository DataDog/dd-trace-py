# Datadog Python APM Integration Registry

This directory contains the canonical registry of integrations supported by `dd-trace-py`.

## Purpose

The `registry.yaml` file serves as a centralized, machine-readable source of truth for metadata about each integration within the `ddtrace/contrib/internal/` directory. This metadata includes essential information about dependencies and version compatibility, used by internal tooling and potentially for documentation generation.

## Format

The registry is stored as a single YAML file: `registry.yaml`. It consists of a root object with a single key, `integrations`, which holds a list of integration definition objects. Each integration object represents one directory found under `ddtrace/contrib/internal/`.

## Schema and Fields

Each integration entry in the `integrations` list adheres to the schema defined in [`_registry_schema.json`](./registry_schema.json). The key fields are:

**Required Fields:**

* **`integration_name`** (String):
  * The canonical, lowercase, snake_case name of the integration
  * Must match the corresponding directory name within `ddtrace/contrib/internal/`
  * Example: `flask`, `redis`, `asyncio`

* **`is_external_package`** (Boolean):
  * `true`: If the integration instruments a third-party library typically installed via pip (e.g., `flask`, `requests`, `psycopg`)
  * `false`: If the integration instruments a Python standard library module (`asyncio`, `logging`) or internal integration (`dbapi`).

**Optional Fields:**

* **`is_tested`** (Boolean):
  * Optional field indicating if the integration has tests
  * Not present if the integration is tested (default behavior)
  * `false` if the integration is explicitly marked as untested

* **`dependency_name`** (List of Strings):
  * Present only if `is_external_package` is `true`
  * Lists the primary PyPI package name(s) associated with the integration
  * For integrations patching multiple underlying libraries (like `elasticsearch`), this may list several names
  * Example: `["flask"]`, `["redis"]`, `["elasticsearch", "elasticsearch1", "opensearchpy"]`

* **`tested_versions_by_dependency`** (Object):
  * Present only if `is_external_package` is `true` and `is_tested` is not `false`
  * Maps dependency names to their tested version ranges
  * Each version range includes:
    * `min`: Minimum tested version
    * `max`: Maximum tested version
  * Example:
    ```yaml
    tested_versions_by_dependency:
      flask:
        min: "2.0.0"
        max: "3.0.0"
    ```

## Updating the Registry

The registry is automatically updated through two main mechanisms:

1. **Test Suite Execution**:
   * Running a riot test suite for an integration automatically updates its version information in the registry
   * This happens through the [`IntegrationRegistryManager`](../../tests/contrib/conftest.py) which tracks patched dependencies and their tested versions during test execution

2. **Manual Update Script**:
   * To update all integration information at once, run from the repository root:
     ```bash
     python scripts/integration_registry/update_and_format_registry.py
     ```
   * This script:
     * Runs [`scripts/freshvenvs.py generate`](../../scripts/freshvenvs.py) to update underlying version data
     * Runs [`scripts/generate_table.py`](../../scripts/generate_table.py) to create the supported versions table
     * Runs [`scripts/integration_registry/_update_integration_registry_versions.py`](../../scripts/integration_registry/_update_integration_registry_versions.py) to update the registry
     * Formats the registry YAML for consistency

## Adding New Integrations

When adding a new integration:

1. Create the integration directory and implementation in `ddtrace/contrib/internal/`
2. Add tests and a corresponding riot test suite in `riotfile.py`
3. Run the test suite - this will automatically:
   * Add the integration to the registry
   * Record its dependency information
   * Track tested version ranges

No manual registry updates are needed - the `IntegrationRegistryManager` and update scripts handle everything automatically.

## Registry Tests

The registry has a test suite in [`tests/contrib/integration_registry/`](../../tests/contrib/integration_registry/):

* [`test_registry_schema.py`](../../tests/contrib/integration_registry/test_registry_schema.py):
  * Validates that the registry YAML content strictly conforms to the JSON schema definition
  * Ensures all required fields are present and correctly formatted
  * Verifies that every directory in `ddtrace/contrib/internal` has a corresponding entry in the registry
  * Checks for any orphaned registry entries that don't have matching directories

* [`test_external_dependencies.py`](../../tests/contrib/integration_registry/test_external_dependencies.py):
  * Validates external package requirements and version information:
    * Ensures external integrations have required `dependency_name` and `tested_versions_by_dependency` fields
    * Verifies version strings follow semantic versioning format
    * Checks that version maps match declared dependencies
  * Verifies all declared dependencies exist on PyPI:
    * Uses `pip index versions` to check each package
    * Validates package names are available and accessible
    * Reports detailed errors for missing or invalid packages
  * Ensures non-external integrations don't have dependency-related fields

* [`test_riotfile.py`](../../tests/contrib/integration_registry/test_riotfile.py):
  * Verifies every integration has corresponding test environments in `riotfile.py`:
    * Checks that each integration directory has a matching riot environment
    * Excludes explicitly untested integrations
    * Reports missing test environment definitions
  * Validates test paths in riot environments:
    * Ensures test paths under `tests/contrib` correspond to actual integrations
    * Handles special cases for utility test environments
    * Verifies proper organization of integration-specific tests
