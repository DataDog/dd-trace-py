"""
This integration provides automatic instrumentation to trace the execution flow
of concurrent execution of ``asyncio.Task``. Also it provides a legacy context
provider for supporting tracing of asynchronous execution in Python < 3.7.

For asynchronous execution tracing in Python < 3.7 to work properly the tracer must
be configured as follows::

    import asyncio
    from ddtrace import tracer
    from ddtrace.contrib.asyncio import context_provider

    # enable asyncio support
    tracer.configure(context_provider=context_provider)

    async def some_work():
        with tracer.trace('asyncio.some_work'):
            # do something

    # launch your coroutines as usual
    loop = asyncio.get_event_loop()
    loop.run_until_complete(some_work())
    loop.close()

In addition, helpers are provided to simplify how the tracing ``Context`` is
handled between scheduled coroutines and ``Future`` invoked in separated
threads:

    * ``set_call_context(task, ctx)``: attach the context to the given ``Task``
      so that it will be available from the ``tracer.get_call_context()``
    * ``ensure_future(coro_or_future, *, loop=None)``: wrapper for the
      ``asyncio.ensure_future`` that attaches the current context to a new
      ``Task`` instance
    * ``run_in_executor(loop, executor, func, *args)``: wrapper for the
      ``loop.run_in_executor`` that attaches the current context to the new
      thread so that the trace can be resumed regardless when it's executed
    * ``create_task(coro)``: creates a new asyncio ``Task`` that inherits the
      current active ``Context`` so that generated traces in the new task are
      attached to the main trace
