"""Instrument pymongo to report MongoDB queries.

The pymongo integration works by wrapping pymongo's MongoClient to trace
network calls. Pymongo 3.0 and greater are the currently supported versions.
``patch_all`` will automatically patch your MongoClient instance to make it work.

    # If not patched yet, you can patch pymongo specifically
    patch(pymongo=True)

    # At that point, pymongo is instrumented with the default settings
    client = pymongo.MongoClient()
    # Example of instrumented query
    db = client["test-db"]
    db.teams.find({"name": "Toronto Maple Leafs"})

    # Use a pin to specify metadata related to this client
    client = pymongo.MongoClient()
    pin = Pin.override(client, service="mongo-master")
