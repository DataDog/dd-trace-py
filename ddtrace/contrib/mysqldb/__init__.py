"""Instrument mysqlclient / MySQL-python to report MySQL queries.

``patch_all`` will automatically patch your mysql connection to make it work.
::
    # Make sure to import MySQLdb and not the 'connect' function,
    # otherwise you won't have access to the patched version
    from ddtrace import Pin, patch
    import MySQLdb

    # If not patched yet, you can patch mysqldb specifically
    patch(mysqldb=True)

    # This will report a span with the default settings
    conn = MySQLdb.connect(user="alice", passwd="b0b", host="localhost", port=3306, db="test")
    cursor = conn.cursor()
    cursor.execute("SELECT 6*7 AS the_answer;")

    # Use a pin to specify metadata related to this connection
    Pin.override(conn, service='mysql-users')

This package works for mysqlclient or MySQL-python. Only the default
full-Python integration works. The binary C connector provided by
_mysql is not yet supported.

Help on mysqlclient can be found on:
