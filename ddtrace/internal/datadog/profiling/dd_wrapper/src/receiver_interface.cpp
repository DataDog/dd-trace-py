// This has to be a .cpp instead of a .c file because
// * crashtracker.c, which builds the receiver binary, has to link to libdatadog-internal interfaces
// * Those interfaces are C interfaces, but they are not exposed in libdd_wrapper.so
// * Exposing them separately increases dist size
// * This forces crashtracker_receiver_entry to be within the same .so
// * The build for libdd_wrapper.so uses C++-specific flags which are incompatible with C
// * It's annoying to split the build into an object library for just one file
