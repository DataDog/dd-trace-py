# Testing in `dd-trace-py` (Python Tracer Library)

## What to Test

- **New features** ➜ Add **unit tests** (happy path + edge cases).
- **Bugfixes** ➜ Add a test that **reproduces the bug on trunk** and passes with your fix.
- **Integrations** ➜ Include **snapshot tests** that send real spans to the APM test agent.

## Where to Put Your Tests

- Add tests to the right folder under `tests/`, e.g. `tests/contrib/yourlib/`.
- For new integrations, create a new `tests/contrib/<integration>` folder.
