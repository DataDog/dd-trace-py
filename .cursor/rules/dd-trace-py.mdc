# dd-trace-py AI Guidelines

All project guidelines, rules, architecture context, and coding standards
live in the canonical file: **`AGENTS.md`** (repository root).

When unsure about implementation details, ALWAYS ask the developer.

Read and follow `AGENTS.md` for:
- Project context and architecture decisions
- Project rules (testing, linting, formatting)
- Code style and AIDEV anchor comments
- PR guidelines
- Skills reference
- Domain glossary
