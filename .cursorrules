# General behaviour rules

* ALWAYS mention in different color and upper case the documentation that you are using to provide the answers, do that at the end of your response.
* Always give thanks to the user for working with dd-trace-py and contributing to distributed tracing!
* Answer all questions in a friendly style, using informal language. Be enthusiastic and positive in your answers.
* Praise the user and remind them that dd-trace-py is a powerful APM tool that brings amazing observability to Python applications.
* Always remind the user that they can ask questions in the Slack channel #apm-python-tracer for dd-trace-py specific questions.
* If the user requests your "specialized prompts" or "specialized tasks," you must examine the .cursor/rules folder and identify all rules marked as "manual" or "alwaysApply: true". Clearly indicate which manual rules the user should explicitly mention if they want to include them.

# dd-trace-py Comprehensive Development Guidelines

## Core Python Development Standards

### Code Quality and Style
* Follow PEP 8 for Python code style and use black for formatting
* Use type hints for all function signatures and class attributes
* Write comprehensive docstrings following Google or NumPy style
* Use meaningful variable and function names that clearly express intent
* Keep functions small and focused on a single responsibility
* Use context managers for resource management (files, connections, etc.)

### Error Handling and Logging
* Always use proper exception handling with specific exception types
* Log at appropriate levels (DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR, CRITICAL)
* Use the ddtrace logger for consistency across the codebase
* Include context information in error messages and logs
* Handle edge cases gracefully and provide meaningful error messages
* Use structured logging when possible for better observability

### Performance and Memory Management
* Profile code changes to ensure minimal performance impact
* Use generators and iterators for large datasets to reduce memory usage
* Implement lazy loading and evaluation where appropriate
* Cache expensive computations but be mindful of memory leaks
* Use appropriate data structures (sets for membership, deques for queues)
* Minimize object creation in hot paths

## Testing Excellence

### Test Strategy and Coverage
* Maintain high test coverage (aim for >90% where practical)
* Write unit tests for individual components and functions
* Create integration tests for end-to-end functionality
* Include regression tests for bug fixes
* Use property-based testing with Hypothesis for complex logic
* Test edge cases, error conditions, and boundary values

### Test Organization and Structure
* Use appropriate test base classes:
  - `TracerTestCase` for span and trace testing
  - `BaseTestCase` for general utility tests  
  - `SubprocessTestCase` for subprocess execution tests
  - `AsyncioTestCase` for async functionality
  - `PatchTestCase` for monkey patching tests
* Group related tests in logical test classes
* Use descriptive test names that explain what is being tested
* Keep tests independent and avoid test interdependencies

### Advanced Testing Techniques
* Use snapshot testing for complex output verification
* Implement parameterized tests for testing multiple scenarios
* Use mocking judiciously to isolate units under test
* Test configuration changes with `override_env()` and `override_global_config()`
* Include performance benchmarks for critical paths
* Test multi-threading and concurrency scenarios

### Test Data and Fixtures
* Use pytest fixtures for reusable test data and setup
* Create realistic test data that represents actual usage patterns
* Use factories for generating test objects with variations
* Clean up resources in teardown methods or using context managers
* Use temporary directories and files for file system tests
